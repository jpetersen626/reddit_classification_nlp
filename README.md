### Problem Statement

Reddit is a website full of many different subreddits. Subreddits are their own forums pertaining to that specific topic, and there are many different ones to look through. After gathering data from two different subreddits, I wanted to see if I could build a binary classification model that could classify text as belonging to either one subreddit or the other. The two subreddits I chose were r/Marvel and r/harrypotter. To measure success, I will be looking at the accuracy score, and whether it beats the baseline model.
