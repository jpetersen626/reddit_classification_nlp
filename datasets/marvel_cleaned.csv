Comics ,False,"In the comics, Nate Grey has gone out of the way to do what he thinks is best for the world, no matter the cost, and he certainly has the power to do so. It would be interesting to see a storyline where they essentially give him the mindset of Dr. Doom and have him take over the world. Basically the God-Emperor Doom story but with Nate Grey instead.

However, where this story diverges is that Nate Grey is basically trying to pull a Leto Atreides/Lelouch Lamperouge/whatever other analogy you want and ensure the future prosperity of humanity by making everyone hate him. I've seen a lot of parallels between him and these characters, and it would be cool to see him live out his own version of their stories. Of course, he has to die in the end, but it's a sacrifice he would make for the greater good of mankind.",Marvel,Interesting idea for Nate Grey storyline
Film/Television,False,"After watching shows that depicted the realistic consequences of superhumans like The Boys and Invincible there were moments from shows like Ultimate Spiderman and Avengers Assemble that made me genuinely think about how dangerous the character's actions were. Notably in the episode where Spiderman captures Dr. Doom and brings him to the helicarrier, he breaks out and goes on a rampage but the episode ends with the team stopping him. We saw SHIELD agents get shot by Doom's robots and I assume they somehow lived for the sake of plot armor but this is not the first time Spiderman or his team members (probably Nova) was wreckless and insubordinate and that that led to similar events. In that particular episode I imagine Spiderman would be declared an actual menace and arrested by SHIELD if his disobeying orders resulted in death. I can't think of too many instances from other shows other than in Avengers Assemble where Stark is repeatedly stubborn and uses probability algorithems despite being cautioned many times that they were not 100% fullproof and we saw how close the Avengers came to death when battling the Cabal. Notably in Season 2 his arrogance endangers the team several times when he tries to pursue Ultron to set Arsenal free, and at times he seems to care more about a robot than his friends. I get that these are targetted for kids but heroes being wreckless, disobedient, or selfish seems to have little long term consequences and I think that's a category that Marvel can explore.",Marvel,If Marvel shows were more mature the consequences of character's actions and themes would be a lot more intense.

It's probably left ambiguous and/or inconsistent, but the logistics of it could make for an interesting plot point. How much a non-hunting vampire has to struggle with it. (Even if one donor with healing factor would make it a simple matter of buying food to be metabolized into blood).

E.g. Moon Knight (currently) has 4 vampires (who refuse to hurt humans) under his protection. At one blood bag per week, per vampire, that would mean over 200 donations needed every year. A healthy adult can donate 4-5 times a year without suffering adverse results. I doubt he feeds them all, but even the one working for him would need about 56 donations a year.

The series is based on him, why do we have to overcrowd it with so many different team members? That's something I hated about Ultimate too, they put Spider-Man in this S.H.I.E.L.D. orchestrated team when he's supposed to be an independent superhero.

And if they did try and go for a Spider-Verse plot at some point, maybe towards the end of the series, I'd love if they just stuck with the core alternate Spideys. To me, they're Spider-Man Noir and Spider-Man 2099. Maybe Spider-Gwen too, but she'd HAVE to come from her OWN universe. Gwen can be in the show's universe, but I don't want her to become Spider-Gwen in the show's universe. She can just be Gwen. Maybe there could be a love triangle going on between Gwen, MJ, and Peter. I'd also love if they stuck Madame Web in there like in Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions.

Consider how long you've been hyped or this movie and how big we expect it to be. Now imagine never being able to experience it in theatres like it's supposed to be. Now imagine having to wait months for the digital release to watch it properly. 


This sucks for all of us here in the middle eastern countries that's not showing the movie. It's actually a bigger deal than it seems. Not to get political but for those of you who aren't living under an authoritarian regime, it does affect your everyday life. From the big stuff to the most insignificant daily routines. So most of us tend to escape this society whenever possible. We follow international news, watch foreign movies, and come to Reddit since it hasn't been discovered and infested by our lovely narrow minded public... yet.


So here's my BIG ask on behalf of all Marvel fans here:
**Can we get a strict NO-SPOILERS rule until the digital release? Just a simple mandatory spoiler tag on any discussion/meme regarding the movie.**

I know some might say ""Just unfollow Marvel subs or avoid Reddit till the movie comes out"" but as I said; for some of us this all we have. This site and subs (with all their problems) are our haven. We can scroll all day and never see a single mention of the shit that's going on around us. We need this.

So consider helping us out. If anything, do it for us Egyptians who provided the world with unnecessary giant triangles, more desert shots in Hollywood that you can remember... and Moon Knight soundtracks.

I love the aesthetic and idea of a story centered around a political fashion show as opposed to fighting. The thing is, I have been unimpressed with a handful of the recent X stories and would not want to read 100+ issues of sub-par stories just to understand the book. 

I suppose it comes down to this: if I only read Hickman's X-Men, skipping XoSwords and all the other titles, is The Hellfire Gala self-contained to the point that I will still understand the book? Beyond that, with all of the above in mind, is it worth getting the Red Carpet edition?

Film/Television,False,"Willem Dafoe is fucking excellent and scary in Spider-Man: No Way Home. That movie gets a whole lot of stuff right, and the Green Goblin is one of them. But what they really get wrong, to me, is Norman Osborn. Norman Osborn...is not a nice, helpless man. He's a slimy evil angry creepy corporate asshole who doesn't love his own son. And the Goblin is not some kind of magical outside presence that possesses him, it's the darker side of him that society has kept repressed finally being unleashed by the serum. 


This was clear in the 60's comicbooks and it's especially clear in the original Raimi movie. Peter Parker in that movie is noticeably genuinely uncomfortable every single time Norman tries to insert himself as a father figure. And plenty of the best villain stuff of Dafoe is when he's not the Goblin. That Thanksgiving dinner where he basically calls MJ a whole? Norman. That ""DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I SACRIFICED??"" in the board room meeting? Norman. His very last moment of appealing to Peter's sympathies while moving the glider into place to try to kill him? NORMAN. 


The Norman Osborn from that original movie would not go to a homeless shelter crying for help, and he would not suddenly not be a villain if he was cured from the serum. Hell, in the comics Osborn was cured, completely free and clear from the Green Goblin personality for almost a decade, and you know what he did during that time? Scammed his way to the very top of S.H.I.E.L.D., created his own team of Avengers made up of supervillains masquerading as heroes, and tried to siege the gates of Asgard.

Film/Television,False,"https://youtu.be/B8hNvVfKP6Y …this is one of the latest Marvel intros, you know where they show old clips from previous big moments, and then it turns into the Marvel Studios logo.

In the past they had drawings with Chris Evans as Cap, the same with Scarlett as Widow, and a couple others,  They still have the character drawings, but not with the actor’s likenesses, like clearly Captain America is Captain America, but it’s not a drawing of Chris Evans as Cap anymore.  In fact they don’t show a masked character without them being unmasked, most likely so they don’t have to keep paying the actor royalties just for a few 3 second clips every time the intro shows up…they even cropped out Chris’s head from the iconic image of Cap slowly throwing the shield.  There’s only 2 people you can still see their likeness for in the images in the intro,  one is Chris Hemsworth as Thor, which makes sense because he is still making Thor movies, and RDJ snapping in Endgame.  Why crop out Evan’s head and yet still incorporate Hemsworth’s Thor, and RDJ as Stark/Iron Man? Because Hemsworth is clearly still Thor, and hopefully, we get RDJ to return as Iron Man.  

But that’s my theory, and it’s built more from hope rather than knowledge.  But it is pretty interesting that they would crop out Evans’ head, but still keep a really clear image of Downey snapping.  Anyway, what’re your guys thoughts?  Do you think RDJ comes back as a Tony Stark variant, or will it be someone else, with Tom Cruise being a big rumor.  Honestly, I think Cruise would be fine, but RDJ is Tony Stark, and I would love to see him play an evil version of him.",Marvel,Want to know why I think RDJ will be in Doctor Strange 2?
Film/Television,False,"And really I only have one point for this. The whole moral in that film was that being a hero wasn’t about being well known or on a team. With the whole “If you’re nothing without the suit, you are nothing at all.” Moral they used, it just rubs me the wrong way that TONY is the one saying this. The guy who’s literal title is a suit of Iron. Instead of sounding strict and serious, it comes off as hypocritical to say the least. I feel like that Steve should’ve been the one to give that pep-talk to Peter, because it fits him as a character more-so. Because Steve doesn’t really do the “I am Iron man” thing, and pronounce himself as that (which was covered in FATWS). To himself, he is just Steve Rogers. And it could’ve been more impactful because we have seen how Steve is as a character throughout the course of FILMS. Again, Tony’s pep-talk feels more hypocritical than if we had Steve as the “Teacher” role, who’s values fit more with the conflict.",Marvel,Unpopular Opinion: Homecoming should’ve happened before civil war.

I recently got the Marvel Unlimited subscription as a gift, and I'm looking for suggestions on some of the best Marvel Comics and storylines to read.

Film/Television,False,I see a lot of people complaining about Mr Knight just being boiled down into Steven’s super suit and how he’s more funny rather than serious. In my opinion the adaptation of Mr Knight in the show is not that bad. I saw a lot of points bring up how he wasn’t that much of a detective based on episode 2 alone however Steven’s profession or well former profession fixes that. He’s knowledgeable in Egypt mythology which allows him to understand things relevant to the goal and solve problems easily. This is mostly shown in episode 3 and 4 with the constellation star and the voice of Ammit. This basically makes him a detective in Egypt knowledge which is who mr knight is. Now for the complaint about mr knight’s personality i can definitely see Steven’s character become a lot more serious near the end turning him into the Mr Knight we all know and love but only time will tell.,Marvel,Mr Knight’s adaptation is not that bad (Moon Knight)

Wanda literally VOLUNTARILY tortured people for revenge?? Took an entire damn town hostage? And saw no problem... With any of it? The only time she showed any remorse for her powers was when it negatively affected her. 

I have all the sympathy for Vision and the twins, but Wanda herself? Yeah, her story is sad. But I mean... How does that make everything she does after the fact okay??

She's not forced into Hydra. She voluntarily rapes peoples' minds. As horrible and sad as it is that Vision is being experimented on - it doesn't justify hurting innocent people! 

And yeah, she eventually ""sacrifices"" her family, but how can you really call it a sacrifice when she was the entire cause and they did nothing? 

And yeah, Agnes is horrible too, but I fail to see how she's more horrible than Wanda? I'd honestly personally prefer to die than to be used as a helpless puppet.

I don't know that I empathize with Agnes, but I definitely don't understand how people empathize with Wanda.

Film/Television,False,"So, I think that Jake is in the Moon Knight show, but is just not shown yet. Some evidence I have for this is that when Mark was fighting the dudes in Kairo, he blacked out, and thought that Steven killed them all. He didn't. Then who did? Jake. Also, on the cover of the show, there are 3 people, Mark's suit, Steven's suit, and then a man. I think that man is Jake. Also, when Mark are running through the ""hospital"" in Mark's ""mind"", he finds a sarcophagus. In that one is Steven. Then, when they are running through again, they see another sarcophagus, but don't check it out. I think in that one, similar to Steven's, had Jake inside of it. And my final theory is that during the end credit scenes, we see all of the suits. The first suit that appears is one that we do not recognize. You could say it is Mark's suit, but his does not have that shape of eye holes. This looks as if it could be a new suit. For Jake.

Comics ,False,Who do you think would win in a fight the Beyonders (Marvel) or Perpetua (Sixth Dimension) DC.,Marvel,The Beyonders
Film/Television,False,"No seriously. I've gone down multiple rabbit holes and spent way too many hours researching everything I can trying to figure this out. And yet-I've quite literally gotten no where. This show makes absolutely no sense to me, and I'm begging for someone to actually explain something, anything to me. I was so excited about this show and it's totally falling flat for me.",Marvel,Can ANYONE explain Moon Knight?
Comics ,False,"Basically just wanting to read deadpool and this run looks fun, is it good and a easy place to start with?",Marvel,How’s the Deadpool by Posehn &amp; Duggan run?
Other,False,"My theory on moon knight that I thought was that there is maybe another conscious beside Steven and mark. My two bits of evidence are whenever mark and Steven are fighting the gang of those three people in episode 3, mark thinks Steven kills them but Steven denies. I believe a third conscious was the one that killed them. Also, in the end of the newest episode we see a third coffin in one of the rooms, with someone in it trying to break out. I believe this could be a third conscious that’s inside of Steven/marks head who hasn’t made an appearance yet. What do you guys think?",Marvel,Random moon knight theory
Comics ,False,"I have heard that knull was the first symbiote and all other symbiotes were made by him. But I've also heard that the enigma force is a symbiote itself. According to a wiki I looked at, they are pretty much counterparts. Are they counterparts in the same way that the one above all and the one below all are Where one of still clearly stronger than the other? Is one stronger than the other?",Marvel,did knull come before the enigma force?
Comics ,False,"Do I need to read through every issue in order to get the main story? And is it worth it? Or is AC not that important to king in black?

Also, i am reading Daredevil currently and it crosses over to king in black do i need to read up on king in black before that issue?",Marvel,"Venom, Absolute Carnage and King in black question"
Comics ,False,"There is a way to time travel, and it is readily available

yet on encounter of death, this option is not even considered",Marvel,One thing I don't understand about death in Marvel Universe
Comics ,False,"People criticize those eras a lot, especially ANAD, but one really cool thing they had was that Marvel let writers pitch some unique and creative new team books, such as: 

The Ultimates (a team that deals with problems on a universal, reality-shattering scale)

The Fearless Defenders (an all-female team of new Valkyries)

The Champions (a team made-up of the youngest heroes)

The U.S.Avengers (an American-themed team with a pretty colorful roster)

The Asgardians of the Galaxy (cosmic team of Asgard-related characters)

Aside from the X-Men, who have had some interesting, original teams (Marauders, Hellions, etc) lately, the only ones I remember recently are Strikeforce and Savage Avengers, and their premise wasn't the most well-defined or engaging.",Marvel,Is it me or we haven't had a cool new team book like the ones we had in the Marvel NOW! and ANAD eras in quite a while?
Film/Television,False,Is the second one a sequel or a reboot? The only thing they have in common is Nic Cage. Even the flashbacks to the Deal are completely different.,Marvel,About the Ghost Rider movies...
Film/Television,False,Is this where Thor Love and Thunder happening???,Marvel,Today i saw Tessa Thompson in Portugal with a filming crew
Film/Television,False,Idk where I should start but I think the superhero movie genre is getting too saturated. I feel like people aren’t making other type of films anymore (they are but most people care about comic movies now),Marvel,Do you think the movie industry is too focused on superhero movies? Rather than making other type of films
Other,False,Ever since black widow I’ve basically been done with the mcu but moon knight actually looks like a good show but I don’t know what do u guys think?,Marvel,Is moon knight worth watching?
Other,False,"I thought she was alright in the comics, but I found it a little strange that she was so good at weilding the hammer even though she didn't have much fighting experience. However I will admit she looked rad in that Love and Thunder trailer. Natalie Portman looked buff! Also, I never cared for the name ""Mighty Thor,"" because that would be like calling She Hulk, Incredible Hulk.",Marvel,What's Your Opinion On Jane Foster Thor?
Comics ,False,"I’ve read the story like 3 times and idk what it is but that always irked me. I know Daredevil is slightly edgier when it comes to his no killing rule when it comes to other characters like Batman or Spider-Man, but it always came across to me as uncharacteristic and just so very wrong. I was wondering what you guys think about this? To me Daredevil was always about acting against your worst impulses and overcoming your dark side to do what’s right, but this isn’t even why I don’t like this. It’s the fact that the whole book is being built up to Daredevil standing up to Fisk and not giving in to his torture and his attempt to break Matt, and Matt trying his hardest to stay true to his values. But maybe there’s some details in the story I didn’t pick up on that you guys noticed or you have a different take. Let me know what",Marvel,(SPOILERS FOR THE “BORN AGAIN” STORYLINE) What are your guys thought on Daredevil killing the helicopter pilot?
Comics ,False,How were the beyonders defeated in the comic,Marvel,The beyoners

Comics ,False,"Hey everyone! Just started reading the Moon Knight Omnibus Vol. 1 and I am loving it so far. I was wondering though, are there any runs/stories that focus more on his relationship with khonshu? Or any stories that have more to do with egypt rather than street crime?",Marvel,Moon Knight Comics
Comics ,False,Haven’t read much since the 90s and never really read Magneto. Is there a consensus best reading order for him? Or is it just find stories he’s in that sound interesting and ho from there? Thanks in advance.,Marvel,Magneto
Comics ,False,"Basically what the title says. Often Marvel events focus on crossovers between groups like Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, etc. 

With all the mythological gods coexisting in the Marvel world like the Norse, Greek, Egyptian, etc, have they all crossed over for some big event? It seems like a natural thing to make a story out of, but I don't think I've heard of any notable stories about that concept",Marvel,Has there ever been an event in the comics where all the mythological pantheons crossover?
Other,False,"Had too much time on my hands and thought of a few mutant powers that would be cool to have 

1. You get double experience from a task. Do something once, you have twice the talent for it. Do it again, you have 4 times the experience. Downside is that you get tired of things too quickly because you'd be good at pretty much anything. But I thought it would be cool. Even better if you can turn it off or on.

2. Emotional telepathy. Imagine forcing someone to instantly feel fear. Or have them immediately feel happy. Not much of a fighting ability but I can think of a few situations where this could be beneficial.

3. Speedy bursts. Not quite flying or having super speed, but imagine being someone who can push off from the ground and pretty much glide at high speeds. You're only a few inches off the ground so you have to keep pushing yourself with your foot but you could cover a lot of ground in a battle. Or be the world's fastest on foot delivery guy idk. It's kinda hard to explain in text.",Marvel,odd but effective powers
Comics ,False,"I'm definitely not someone who thinks the MCU is the be-all and end-all of Marvel characters. In fact Iron Man may be the only exception where I prefer his film counterpart. (Maybe Loki, and Rocket too) I've been reading a lot of marvel comics chronologically and i'm roughly at around 2011/12 -ish and any time Tony shows up I hate him. Is there any point in-between then and now where he actually becomes charming like RDJ's portrayal rather than absolutely insufferable?",Marvel,Does 616 Tony Stark ever become likeable?
Film/Television,False,"In Infinity War the Maw tells Thanos no one has ever had the might, nay the nobility to wield more than one Infinity Stone. However, in the Avengers Loki was in possession of both the Scepter and the Tesseract. What are your thoughts? Does it count or not?",Marvel,Wielding more than one Infinity Stone
Film/Television,False,"""Morbius"" had several things going against it, and one of them was the PG-13 rating. Vampires suck blood. You can't make a movie about vampire and show as little blood as possible. ""Morbius"" was hurt by showing as little blood as possible.

And with the news that ""Blade"" will most likely be PG-13, it makes me worried about it. ""Blade"" is another movie about vampires, and showing as little blood as possible will hurt the movie.

The previous three movies understood that blood is essential to a vampire movie, and thus didn't shy away from showing blood. But this movie will show little blood as possible, and that will hinder the movie.

But that's my take on it. What do you think? Do you think ""Blade"" will work with a PG-13 rating, or not?",Marvel,"""Morbius"" being PG-13 makes me worried for ""Blade"""
Film/Television,False,"The MCU obviously has a much bigger pop culture reach than any other form of Marvel media, so characters that get showcased in the MCU stand to gain a lot in the way of their profile and popularity. At the same time, the MCU takes some creative liberties at times and reinvents aspects of some characters compared to their comic book counterparts.

So my question to you all is, which characters would you say have benefitted the most from being included in the MCU, either in terms of their popularity or a positive reimagining of some aspect of their character?

The GotG are the obvious example, but curious who else you feel has really gotten a boost!",Marvel,Which characters do you think have benefitted the most from being featured in the MCU?
Film/Television,False,Other than the CGI,Marvel,What are your thoughts on the MOONKNIGHT show
Other,False,"I’ll go first:

When the Fantastic Four first began, they lived in a city called [Central City](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Central_City?so=search) in California. The city eventually went on to be sent into the future by the Fantastic Four after a man named Harvey Jessup built a dome over it that sped up time for its inhabitants.",Marvel,What’s your favorite fun Marvel fact that most people don’t know?
Comics ,False,Is this a good website to use for a reading order? Thanks for the help!    https://marvelguides.com/,Marvel,Reading order?
Other,False,"Pretty basic question.

A friend and I was talking about this and it was an interesting topic, so I'd like to see other people's opinions and ideas.

I said Doctor Strange, Wolverine, Spider-Man, Ironman and Professor X would make pretty powerful villains, especially Professor X

For villains turning heroes, I said that I thought Thanos with all stones / gems as a hero would pretty much be unstoppable and that Bullseye would be an amazing shield agent if he was a good guy.

So what are your thoughts?",Marvel,What Marvel heroes would be unstoppable as villains? And which Marvel villains would make good heroes?
Film/Television,False,I want to interact with this bit of twitter any accounts you would recommend me to follow,Marvel,Marvel/Film/Tvshows Twitter
Film/Television,False," 

The squadrone supreme is the marvel universe stand-in for the justice league, with the most recurring members being [Blur](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Stanley_Stewart_(Mephisto%27s_Simulacrum)_(Earth-616)), [Doctor Spectrum](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Joseph_Ledger_(Mephisto%27s_Simulacrum)_(Earth-616)), [Hyperion](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_Milton_(Mephisto%27s_Simulacrum)_(Earth-616)), [Nighthawk](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Kyle_Richmond_(Mephisto%27s_Simulacrum)_(Earth-616)), [Power Princess](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Zarda_(Mephisto%27s_Simulacrum)_(Earth-616)), i think they should introduce the squadron as full, all powerfull team in an alternative universe, in a live action show or movie, most likely loki season 2, it could be a play on the dceu or snyder version of the jl (in that case the universe could be all black and white and with a smaller aspect ration) , or it could be more like the huge team in the 80s comics, also taking place around that time.

and then the event of the incursions start to happen and we have a squadron based on the version of 2016 comics, made of various members from worlds destroyed by the illuminati of the mcu who want to stop them from destroying other worlds, and for revenge, and maybe this is how the various people of the mcu find out about the incursions happening, all to set up secret wars",Marvel,how the squadron supreme should be introduced in the mcu Discussion
Comics ,False,Sorry I’ve been out of the comic book world for a while so can anyone give me info on what happened with Ben Reilly and i’ve heard from a while that Ben Reilly has taken over for Peter and I’ve seen that Peter has come does anyone know what happen with Ben,Marvel,So it seems like Peter’s back to being spidey and one question I have does anyone know what happened to Ben Reilly
Other,False,Basically his name just means Black black jaguar or leopard. As panther is not a single species but a variety of a  jaguar or leopard which has an excess of melanin (dark pigment) which makes it black. Therefore making the name black panther a tautology.,Marvel,"Ok, so I love black panther he’s one of my favourite characters from the MCU but his name could use some work."
Fan Made,False,"Earlier today someone posted a video from a scene in Civil War when the Avengers were in a board room watching news footage on tv. But this was edited instead with footage of the actors in real life doing stupid stuff. 

It was a great video but when I was trying to show my wife  it was deleted. Does anyone know the video and where.  Could find it?",Marvel,Help finding video
Film/Television,False,"I've had my issues with each episode so far, but the latest episode really did me in.

You're telling me, you have literal gods on earth, who absolutely do not want Ammit freed. They hold an immediate trial after barely talking to Konshu for 5 minutes, and then simply believe Harrow based on... his words? Like, not a single one of them was like ""eh up actually what you doing over there in the middle of the desert?""

Konshu/Marc didn't wanna be like ""oh yeah what about that tattoo that kills people? What about your cult? Why don't you go check out this burrow in London where they all worship Ammit? What about that staff you have that summons big doggos?""

Literally could've said A N Y T H I N G

ArE YOu UnWeLl?",Marvel,Moon Knight is infuriating
Film/Television,False,"Stopped watching marvel movies and shows after Endgame. Now I want to jump back onto the wagon, with the new Dr Strange movie.
Need the recommendation to watch whatever has been released in between and in what order, so I don’t miss any references or plot points in Multiverse of madness.",Marvel,Need the sequence to watch after Endgame
Comics ,False,"So there are 2 volume 1s of moon knight,  one is called the midnight Mission and the other volume 1 is called from the dead but again the midnight mission volume is also called volume 9 , I am so confused,  please  explain , || also please tell how to find if a comic series in earth 616 because when I read immortal hulk the wiki says immortal hulk series is earth 616 but then how come normal hulk also exist in 616 ? ? ?",Marvel,I need help with marvel comics ( I am new )
Other,False,"Marvel tends to have its own versions of DC characters, and vise versa. Which group of young Marvel heroes do you think matches the theme of the Teen Titans?",Marvel,Who do YOU think is Marvel’s equivalent of DC’s Teen Titans?
Other,False,"Exactly what the title says. I say this because comic hulk cannot be killed, and even if he somehow is, he comes back as an eldrich horror. Motherfucker doesn’t need to breathe, he just does it because he can! His power is literally infinite as long as he is angry. The mcu hulk is a green teddy bear with anger issues and suicidal tendencies.",Marvel,The mcu hulk is a fucking joke character only because the comic version is overpowered as hell
Film/Television,False,"I’m spider man no way home Tom asked if toby universe or Andrew universe had the Avengers and they did not so technically 
Wolverine, Deadpool and any other movie could be in the universe?",Marvel,Could all Marvel movies typically be in the cinematic universe?
Comics ,False,The Golden statue with thunder,Marvel,Who js this guy from the trailer
Comics ,False,"So I kind of missed out on the whole Ultimate Universe thing.  Can someone give me a brief rundown on this? I'm looking to pick up and read some Secret Wars stuff but feel I should know about this Ultimate Universe business first. Also is the 2015 ""Secret Wars"" the typically preferred Secret Wars series? Thanks in advance for any guidance you can provide.",Marvel,Ultimate Universe???
Film/Television,False,So i had a random question. if the multiverse supposedly has every reality is there a reality that doesn’t have a multiverse? if so how does that work? if not how come?,Marvel,Multiverse logic?
Film/Television,False,"i cant remember the name of the movie, but seemingly against all odds the good guys beat the bad guys",Marvel,In which Marvel movie do the good guys beat the bad guys?
Film/Television,False,Can you theoretically obtain a sample of the serum that made him who he is by blood?,Marvel,so I have a question about captain america
Other,False,I was just thinking about the amount of universe and how some of the characters are pretty neat and it would be cool if DC and marvel were able to work together to bring those characters to life. And then it got me wondering what other people thought of that idea.,Marvel,Bringing the amalgam universe to the big screen
Film/Television,False,"MINOR SPIDER-MAN NWH SPOILERS!



I was rewatching the iron man movies the other day, and a few things caught my eye. For one, it says Tony Stark went to MIT, and in Spider-Man NWH, Peter is trying to go to MIT with his friends. In Spider-Man FFH, Peter is making his own suit, which is obviously like Tony, but that’s not what’s the most interesting to me. The song they use during that scene “back in black” was also the song used at the beginning of Iron Man 1. Peter is also stubborn like Tony. I’ll be adding a comment to this if I find more similarities later!",Marvel,Peter really is like Tony!
Comics ,False,"I've read Hickman's Avengers run a couple times, it's one of my favorite stories in comics.  I recently read his FF run for the first time and I'm a bit confused with Dr. Doom.  He gets trapped in his own world after staying behind in the Council of Reeds area and uses an infinity gauntlet to start his own world in his vision.  Since he creates it in his vision the people there think like him and rise up against him, resulting in him getting put in jail and eventually rescued by the FF.  

After they rescued him he states that being a god doesn't suit him.  What changes between this and Secret Wars?  While part of the reason he took the Beyonders power is because Dr. Strange didn't want it, he also seems to enjoy being god Doom.  Is there more to the story outside Avengers/New Avengers that I need to read prior to that that explains Doom's change?  I do think its interesting that Battleworld is formed this time out of actual worlds instead of his vision, yet it fails as well anyways. 

Also, regarding older Franklin and Valeria... is there anywhere that continues their story?  I find it interesting that they both show up to prevent the world ending event in FF yet neither shows up during the events of Avengers/New Avengers.",Marvel,Question about Dr. Doom in Hickmans Run
Other,False,Would they merge into one creature? Would they explode? Would the blip victim just come back next to the person?,Marvel,What if somebody was in the same location as a victim of the blip when they were snapped back?
Film/Television,False,"https://youtu.be/Wy0dDmeXHeU
When Marc takes control a certain song comes on and I can't find it anywhere. Anybody care to share the link?",Marvel,Anybody know what's the music called?
Other,False,"Sorry if it's in the wrong sub, but i don't know where to ask.
I've been searching an old post on tumblr where they showed comics of hulk working (?) In a farm and being good with animals (i remember that in a panel he say that horses like to be gently held).
I think the post also talked how Hulk is wrongly used as a form of toxic masculinity.
Thank you for your time.",Marvel,Searcing a lost tumblr post on Hulk
Film/Television,False,Why is Gamora?,Marvel,"Everyone is asking where is Gamora in the new Thor trailer, but no one’s asking…"
Other,False,"And his suit still runs out of power at times.
Let that sink in...",Marvel,Fun fact: Tony's arc reactor produces enough electricity to power a small city
Film/Television,False,In episode 3 we saw steven turn back the night and in the ending he doesn't change it back so does that mean earth time travel 2000 years pass or simply he just moved around the planets and suns to the position it is on 2000 years ago or in the next episode it will turn back to present night,Marvel,Did moon knight time travel the earth or can he moved the planets and sun
Comics ,False,"And, I have to say, I haven't read this bad comic in a long time. There was no necessary world building for a alternate universe, no nothing, just Deadpool slashing. This comic is literally the definition of all style and no substance.",Marvel,Just finished reading Deadpool kills marvel universe
Other,False,"Just let me know which comics I should start with for each superhero, or the Avengers and X-Men.",Marvel,I have never read a Marvel comic before. Which ones should I start with?
Film/Television,False,This guy told me marvel was meant for children. How should I respond,Marvel,??
Film/Television,False,"The show so far is boring and will only lead to the final episode being the best. All the episodes so far have been a bunch of pointless exposition to stretch out the run time of each episode. Disney and Marvel need to stop making these awful series and go back o focusing on introducing characters in movies. The only redeeming part about the show is Konshu but he’s just a knockoff Venom. 3/10 terrible dialogue, boring characters, and somewhat decent action scenes.",Marvel,Moonknight series is terrible
Film/Television,False,https://youtu.be/mqtjPIOqOwc,Marvel,Thor Love and Thunder Teaser is out !!!!!
Film/Television,False,"After watching Agents of SHIELD about 3 months ago, I never thought about the plot holes back then. However, some have come to light recently.

Apparently Agents of SHIELD ignored the blip, but the directors said that it was pre-blip. Some have pointed out that Thanos was mentioned in the TV show during season 5, but I cannot remember him being mentioned.

The one that I have noticed is that Agents of SHIELD completely ignores that the TVA existed because during season 7, they create an alternate timeline, but the original timeline still existed.

What is happening?! Is SHIELD in a different multiverse now?",Marvel,New plot hole? SHIELD and TVA
Comics ,False,"If any one has any recommendations for what to start on for these hero's, let me know",Marvel,I like moon knight and miles morales
Other,False,So can we expect anything on ghost rider cause all I remember of him is the last movie that came out so will there be any cameo in upcoming movies or a dedicated movie for his story...,Marvel,Hey can anyone answer
Other,False,Why weren’t the TVA in X-Men Days of Future Past,Marvel,TVA in X-Men Days of Future Past.
Film/Television,False,"The Ennead made me mad. You think that they would go investigate what Arthur was going after Khonshu moved the stars. Khonshu knew that he was going to get imprisoned and did it anyway. You think that at least one of them would have been like ""Maybe we should PHYSICALLY go and see why.""",Marvel,Thinking about Moon Knight ep 3
Other,False,Just for fun explain why and how they would react to his presence.,Marvel,"[Discussion] What if John Jonah Jameson, Jr. is Omni Man."
Other,False,"There is some criticism directed at Captain America that he is such a decent dude that he can come across as boring sometimes. it is also levelled at Superman sometimes.

Although I like Spiderman and Peter, I think peter too can be boring and 1 dimensional. Compared to let's say Bruce Wayne who has an edge and some darkness within him or Tony Stark who is a very interesting cahracter particularly going by the comics. Peter Parker is too pure a soul and that kind of makes him less interesting.

I think it's his powers &amp; his rogues gallery that are the real stars. 

What do you folks think?",Marvel,Is Peter Parker compelling enough a character?
Other,False,"My girlfriend is new to marvel comics and wants to get started.

Other,False,"This series has really grown on me. I used to avoid it due to the animation style, but when I went to sample the first few episodes, I was hooked. It’s a really good show that, while the animation is pretty dated, anyone who dismissed it back then should take another look. It’s way more digestible now. The bad animation is more funny to laugh at than irritating. It really deserved a lot more credit, especially since it was concurrent with the success of the 1st Iron Man film. It should’ve gotten some Easter eggs over the years, or should’ve had a drop of inspiration taken from it. Maybe in Endgame , they could’ve made an orchestral version of the theme song? Or made the theme song his ringtone? Maybe Gene Khan type rival in Iron Heart tv show? Not even any of their villains?

Comics ,False,"So when Fox still owned the rights to Marvel IP in films, the Marvel execs decided to push Mutants out and tried to make Inhumans more popular among the fans just so later they can make films about them.  I think they missed the point of why Mutant stories were popular in Marvel and in all of comics (I can't remember any other comic-related franchise that is more popular than X-Men).  Starting with Uncanny X-Men, Stan Lee was pushing this species as almost human but uncanny (i.e. creepy).  As in they have an uncanny similarity to humans but they are not quite human.  

I think the writers in Marvel understood this distinction (props to Chris Claremont's great stories) and over time created more characters whose powers are invasive and creepy like mind-reading, mind-control, shape shifting, phasing through walls, teleportation, telekinesis or matter control, etc.  Those powers invade the safety of ordinary and powered people in Marvel that just by existing they made everybody feel unsafe and nothing is private anymore.  Imagine living in a house with four walls and secure locks but you still would not feel safe because a mutant can easily go into your house with their uncanny abilities, would you or anyone else feel safe?  What about passwords and daily relationships?  Not safe as long as mind-readers, mind-controllers and shape shifters exist. So the natural instincts of people would be to be afraid of mutants, to the point of being angry and then persecuting them.  This is why there are several stories about somehow neutralizing Mutant abilities in Marvel, they're not evil stories the general public just want to feel relatively safer and they can maintain privacy without looking out for Mutants invading them.

As great as the Inhumans abilities are, they are not uncanny and therefore cannot fill the niche that Mutants currently occupy.  They can write persecution stories against Inhumans all they want but what would be the basis for this?  There is no deeper reason for persecution and fear against beings that are just the same as regular Avengers abilities.  Just as people in Marvel don't persecute Asgardians, Atlanteans and creatures of alien origin, I don't see any reason why Inhumans would be persecuted without some contrived unrealistic storyline.

TLDR; Mutants are persecuted because their creepy abilities to mind-read, teleport, shape shift, phase through walls causes safety problems for people just because mutants exist.  Inhumans while being powered beings are not creepy nor uncanny enough to replace Mutants.",Marvel,Why I think Mutant stories are Popular and Inhumans couldn't have replaced them.

Games,False,"Sorry if anyone came to this thinking a Thanos game had been announced. Also not entirely sure if this is the right place to post this so again, sorry if it’s not. 

Just thought I’d come share my thoughts since Thanos is a character who has always interested me. With insomniac making two games for spiderman and now also a wolverine game, Im hoping that they branch this out and create many games for many different characters from marvel- some of which being villains. I hope it’s not just me that would want this! Imagine a game where you play as Thanos and have to gather the infinity stones(whether this is achieved in the same way as the movies, or in a different way to spice things up, I don’t mind at all). I just think it would be so cool to have a proper game where you can use each infinity stone’s abilities with the gauntlet.

I’m only new into comics if I’m being honest so I’m not entirely sure what characters could be included but boss battles against characters that have never been seen in live action before could be introduced into the game. This would allow two, essentially gods, battle against eachother. 

If this is a bad idea then I apologise but Thanos is a personal favourite of mine and I would love nothing more than to see him as a playable character in his own solo story created by a good game developer such as insomniac.

Other,False,"*This idea doesn’t fit into any timeline, and doesn’t make any sense. I just thought it would be cool.*

So, I watching Spider Man: Far from Home a few months ago, and thought about what would happen if the main villain of the movie, Mysterio, got the reality stone. It was a cool thought that a villain known for creating grand scale illusions to trick people having the power to make those illusions whenever he wanted, and also make them REAL. 

The i got to thinking, and I said “hey, wasn’t Mysterio part of the sinister six?” Then I applied the same line of thinking of “villains getting infinity stones” to the rest of the six, and boom. The Infinite Six is born.

Here’s a quick rundown of who would have what stone:
- Mysterio: Reality *reasons for this have already been stated*
- Doctor Octopus: Mind *it would give him complete control over his arms, and allow him to attach 2 more without any issue. (That will become important later)*
 - Electro: Power *with electros goal of wanting to become pure energy, it makes sense that he would be able to focus the power of the power stone to achieve that. Also purple lighting. Enough said.*
- Sandman: Time *i literally just thought of the “sands of time” and then gave him the time stone, but then I got to thinking, and realized that a potential plot point could be that he starts to cling to his past and see his daughter using the time stones abilities, and realized that time stone genuinely made sense for him.*
- Vulture: Space *if vulture had the ability to teleport along with his masterful flying skills, he would be untouchable.*

They butchered his character, who was a complex and dark, gritty anti-hero vigilante so much. They couldn’t just stick to the source material, they needed him to fit their “TV-14”, “family friendly” formula that they refuse to break. It’s like they took those meme comic-strips from fake Moon Knight panels seriously. If the MCU would just take themselves seriously for once in their entire fucking existence, they could turn this into one of the best MCU products out there. Not everything has to be an action/comedy. You should be able to have serious drama and grit in your products. The new A24 film Everything Everywhere All At Once is a perfect example of how you can have comedy intertwined in your story and still take yourself seriously. I’m not trying to make this some “shit on disney” rant, but more of frustration because of the repetitive nature of the MCU, despite what their topic is. They shouldn’t handle Moon Knight the same way they handle Spider-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy. I think Moon Knight perfectly displays how the typical MCU formula doesn’t work everything.

What was so sensational about She-Hulk #3? For one, nobody got punched! The whole issue, nobody was smacked in the face! Now how often can you say that about a Marvel comic?

I understand that action is important for comic books, but repetitive action sequences with characters that aren't going to die can lose their impact after a while.

What else did I like? The history! She-Hulk dives into Marvel history and continuity without any qualms. Jenn references Avengers Disassembled, her recent troubles as monster She-Hulk, and even Jack-of-Hearts's back story!

Finally, I loved the connections to the Marvel Universe. In the 1970's, 80's, and even '90s, if a hero so much as sneezed in a Marvel comic, it was mentioned in the other titles. I liked this interconnection, it made me feel like I was part of a whole universe.

Jen's call to Patsy (Hellcat) and her reference to Patsy's dating Tony Stark sucked me into the Marvel Universe. 

Too many titles are ending the world all the time. For example, in the Avengers, Manhattan was taken over by an Egyptian God but it felt like it happened in a bubble. Nobody mentioned it anywhere else from what I could tell.

Somebody just blew up the moon in another recent Marvel comic and it had no impact on the wider Marvel Universe.

Other,False,"I'm talking abput tolerance to pain, and not strength. When it comes to strength, I've read he gets stronger the angrier he gets. But I'm sure there's an actual limit (which I'd also like to know).

Ice read he has a healing factor just like Deadpool and Wolverine. But in Old Man Logan (I believe), when Maestro tries to take over a small town, they shoot at him with assault rifles. It doesn't even penetrate his skin. And it seems to not hurt him. I'm sure the Hulk (616 Hulk) is the same. But I remember a panel somewhere where Wolverine's adamantium claws can stab Hulk head.

But in the Edward Norton movie, he gets hit with RPG's, and it doesn't even pierce his skin at all. But later in the movie, when he takes his gf or wife to the cave (don't remember her name), he bumps his head on the ceiling of the cave, and grunts in pain and rubs his head. That bumping his head was a lot less bad as RPG's hitting him. So that must've hurt like hell. (Does he also get tougher with anger?)

Film/Television,False,"In The Falcon and The Winter Soldier episode 5, toward the end when they were practicing throwing the shield at trees and stuff, Bucky apologized and said neither of them understood what it meant to give the shield to a black man. What was he talking about? At no point did that ever come up with Bucky as far as I recall? Maybe I missed something?

Comics ,False,"Do any writers ever write magneto to his theoretical potential, with things like plasma, and electricity manipulation, can he stop synapses in the brain or neural signals to stop someone’s heart?

I’ve seen lots debates that he would have been able to solo thanos and that’s always countered by “we don’t know if the gauntlet was ferrous” but that ignores the other implications of what magnetism can really do. It also looks like thanos has ferrous blood so unless he’s anemic, magneto should be able to pull off something similar to dr manhattan popping Rorschach. I know it’s all moot since in the comics magneto doesn’t do a damn thing to stop thanos, which is disappointing because he fights pretty hard to protect people in marvel zombies.",Marvel,Magneto’s capabilities.

Film/Television,False,"As a long time fan of Marc Spector, Jake Lockley, Steven Grant, Khonshu and all, I had been excited for the show since it’s announcement way back when. The depth of the character portrayed in Lemire’s run is what made me fall in love with the character. My doubts arose at the first trailer for the series which depicted a character unfamiliar to me, who was supposed to be someone I have known for a long time—Steven Grant. But I am pained to say I don’t think I can enjoy the way they adapted the character like they had with other introductions. They nixed all of what made the character unique and replaced it with a whole new character. The series doesn’t feel like it was made for its fans, but for a whole new group of viewers. It was painful for me to sit through the first two episodes. Although I see it as a failure to bring Moon Knight from the comics into big screen, I think the premise of the show is enjoyable to those unfamiliar with the character, which is the majority. It doesn’t seem like there’s any middle ground between long time fans of Moon Knight and people new to the character in the show. I don’t know if any other fans agree with me, but I know the majority will disagree with me, which I wish I did too because I want to enjoy the series. Anyways that’s my two cents about the show, not that anyone cares to be honest.",Marvel,"Moon Knight: a good show, but an awful adaptation."

And I'm annoyed by how Marc is still so reluctant and hesitant to bring out the Moon Knight, especially when things are obviously getting so bad that MK is more than needed and he's just watching it happen before doing it. That big action scene in episode 3 is very guilty of that. I'm like ""FFS just let the sumbitch out already!"".

Film/Television,False,"We had a little foreshadowing of his existence back in episode 1. Steven was unaware of the steak date because he didn’t arrange it, but Marc wouldn’t have arranged it either because he’s the guy that wanted to divorce his wife and semi faked his death to her just so she’d stay away from him and be safe. Episode 3 pretty much confirms Jake’s existence entirely though. There are a few times when Marc blacks out and then when he regains control of the body he shares with Steven and now Jake too, there’s bloodied corpses around him. Marc judges Steven for doing it because he thinks it’s just the two of them in Moon Knight’s body but as we know it most definitely was not Steven as he’s quite frankly just a very gentle guy. Plus Steven literally says it wasn’t him. So it must be Jake if it wasn’t Marc or Steven but we’re yet to meet him properly.",Marvel,Moon Knight episode 3 basically confirms Jake Lockley

Film/Television,False,"Thor Ragnarok is a movie that just keeps on improving in the fun factor. The finale battle scene is probably my favorite action scene from the MCU.

So throughout the movie Thor gets his ass kicked or has very little of his original power. Without the hammer he feels weak. And when he isn't featured on screen, we see Hela go from strength to strength and is able to gain absolute power just about when the gang gets back to Asgard from Sakkar.

The bridge battle ensues and it climaxes with the superb scene as Thor finally gets his mojo back and makes an entry. The Immigrant Song from Led Zeppelin kicks back on again providing a rock'n roll theme as the ass kicking reaches new heights. Thor is rolling thunder left &amp; right. The mischievous Loki is seen fighting for his own people, a rare sight. Fireworks go off in the background as Valkyrie dons her original costume and gets into proper action mode. Hulk &amp; Fenris the Wolf engage in a ridiculous monster fight. And you got Korg &amp; Meek looking cute while fighting.

All in all, it's fantastic spectacle. The CGI in the Bifrost bridge is brilliant, the music is excellent and the action is amazing. You also get character moments with Thor (regaining his confidence) &amp; Loki (letting go of his selfish nature for a moment) which adds emotional stakes to the fight.

I rate this scene 10/10. Always a fun watch.",Marvel,The final battle on the Bifrost bridge at Asgard is the just the coolest.

Comics ,False,So I just got a three month subscription to marvel unlimited and am planning on renewing it once it’s done. Thing is I’ve never read a comic book before and have no idea where to start. I’ve always followed marvel but have mostly gotten information just by reading wikis or watching you tube break downs. Any recommendations on how to dive into the real thing?

However, the MCU Steven Grant appears to be a loner with poor social skills and broke as shit. They went full 180 with this guy. Until I knew this info I was fine with him as I had no prior knowledge of Moon Knight but after reading up on him Im confused as to why they went the direction that they did. s",Marvel,How does everyone feel about the MCU version of Steven Grant?
Film/Television,False,"* “Daredevil is the best MCU show ever.” ***Its not even part of the MCU.***
* “Daredevil is the better than MOST MCU content.” ***Its not even better than Loki.***

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Intro**

For some reason, there is a strong cult following for Daredevil on this sub. Has this sub become r/ Daredevil? The strong hive mind will stand on this hill of Daredevil being the best MCU show ever, **while not being produced by Marvel Studios/Feige at all**. I unequivocally disagree that Daredevil is the best MCU content ever. It was long, painful, dark, and boring at times. Wandavision and Loki are superior watching experiences. Here's why:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;**Acting**

* **Elizabeth Olsen** can act circles around **Deborah Ann Woll**
* **Tom Hiddleston** owns the actor playing Daredevil
* **Owen Wilson** and **Paul Bettany** are much better options than **Elden Henson** (Foggy)
* Overall the acting in Wandavision or Loki is superior to the acting in Daredevil.
* The actors in Daredevil series are C-level at best.
* Why do you think **Matt Murdock** had a 30 second cameo in NWH and not a fight scene? Levels.
* **Jonathon Majors** is a way better actor than Kingpin",Marvel,Daredevil is an overrated show
Games,False,"Let's be real, Enix fucked up Avengers so bad. Filled it with unnecessary, overpriced micro-transactions and terrible DLC, (looking at you, Spider-Man) not to mention the writing wasn't good at all and even worse the level design. I understand it's a linear game, but it feels like a cross between a 3D platformer and an MMO RPG.

Guardians really did it for me. Was still linear but definitely had more freedom than Avengers. No micro-transactions or shitty DLC, the writing was a lot better and even enjoyable, and the level design made it feel a lot more open. Definitely gave me different, better vibes, and I think Enix redeemed themselves with this game.",Marvel,Can we admit that Square Enix redeemed themselves with Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy?
Comics ,False,"So this run was on my to read list for a couple of months now, but i didn't want to get into it until it's over.  Does Devil's Reign work as a satisfying ending to the series? How good was the event?",Marvel,Is Zdarsky's Daredevil run finished?
Comics ,False,"For me Wanda ( Scarlet witch ) is the most strongest avenger. what do you guys think??

Film/Television,False,"hi.

Comics ,False,So why exactly does Baron Mordo call himself Baron? I reckon only England uses noble ranks I. The present days. Is he a baron?,Marvel,Question about Baron Mordo
Film/Television,False,I haven't seen a single marvel movie since Far From Home and plan on watching No Way Home very soon. Are any of the other phase 4 films worth watching?,Marvel,Phase 4 films worth watching?
Other,False," **Why did the Celestials not try to prevent Thanos from wiping out half of all life in the universe?**

i mean, i sort of understand the excuse of eternal not interfering if deviants weren't involved, but if the entire purpose of eternals is to take care of species so a new celestial will be born; why didn't any celestial do anything about wiping half of the universe? wouldn't that slow down the process of many celestials being born for a long time in all the universe?",Marvel,I have a question about the celestials

Film/Television,False,"The actor that plays Vincent d'onofrio that plays the kingpin in daredevil and in Hawkeye the same? Is it just a coincidence they're the same actor or in later seasons it plays a role in the story? 

I've watched all of Hawkeye and haven't watched past episode 6 of daredevil season 1.",Marvel,daredevil and Hawkeye intertwined?
Other,False,Yeah i want to know,Marvel,What is y’alls opinion on The Abundant Glove?
Other,False,"During Electros intro scene he appears slowly manifesting next to some power lines and his appearance is a very ghostly looking energy form with bright white eyes which was never seen before. It made me wonder was electro truly dead in his own universe and this was his ghost? And the “new power” in the MCU somehow returned him to life thus bringing back his true human form?
Idk just a theory of mine",Marvel,Was electro a ghost in NWH?
Artwork,False,"If you, like me, have started watching the Moon Knight show and are thoroughly enjoying it, and have started to make fanarts, there is a dope collaborative effort on Instagram right now!

(I havent read the comics btw so i may be missing something)",Marvel,How can there be infinite universes in the multiverse?
Film/Television,False,It literally shows a dude finding a fourth Spider-Man through rewatching it over and over and noticing Easter eggs. Is there a chance that Sony outright told us that there’s a fourth Spider-Man?,Marvel,Anyone else seen the new Spider-Man no way home commercial?
Film/Television,False,AAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!,Marvel,Just literally started Moonknight and less than two minutes in….
Comics ,False,"Before you say that Gwen Stacy sleeping with old Norman Osborn and getting impregnated by him never happened. It didn't happen, its best we live in denial than to live in a world where that happened yikes and eww.

Film/Television,False,"Just wondering if there are any other avatars from the comics. I know that Black Panther is an avatar for the goddess Bastet and the Sun King is an avatar for Ra, but it looks like they’re hinting at other possible Egyptian avatars. Can the Norse gods have avatars as well?",Marvel,Moon Knight other Avatars
Film/Television,False,With his portal things,Marvel,Why doesn’t dr strange just kill thanoas?
Comics ,False,"Obviously they aren't going to do an individual panel for each handsign, both because they would use too much space and because a large part of their audience wouldn't understand a thing. And they can't use speech bubbles as that would probably be mistaken for spoken language. So how would they show their audience what Echo is trying to say?",Marvel,How doe Marvel show the character of Echo communicating via sign language in comics?
Comics ,False,"Hello! 
This has probably been asked quite a bit recently, but what’s the best avenue to read up on moon knight? 

I always had a pretty surface level knowledge of who he was, but since the show came out I figure I should spend some more time learning about the character.  

Thanks all",Marvel,Jumping on the MK train
Other,False,"I want to see the Eternals go to Sakaar and have a new, Kirby-inspired look which is closer to the comics version. Make it colourful and fun and nice way to retcon without rebooting them.",Marvel,Eternals: Sakaar treatment for the sequel
Film/Television,False,"Now that Tom Holland's Peter Parker has learned that ""with great power, there must also come great responsibility,"" do you think that his character is going to get so much better in the next trilogy? 

Tom clearly underwent so much character development in this film. Not only did May die, which is the MCU equivalent of Uncle Ben's death, but she also said the famous line that shaped both Tobey and Andrew's Spider-Men, ""with great power, there must also come great responsibility."" On top of all the stories and teachings that Tobey and Andrew gave to Tom, I think Tom's character is going to get so much better from here on out. I think that Tom is finally starting to grow out of ""Iron Man Jr,"" and is starting to cross the Spider-Man line. The web line.

The ending of this film was just beautiful too. The fact that he had nothing except Spider-Man, the fact he had to move into a shitty apartment, alone, the fact that he had to sew his own suit with no tech was just amazing for his character. And now he's probably going to have to get a job at the Daily Bugle taking pictures of himself for Jameson to use to slander him. Tom is finally shaping up to officially take on the role of Spider-Man that we all wanted, what we hoped and what we knew he could eventually be.

I think this makes Homecoming and Far From Home infinitely better now that we know he makes it in the end. He gets there eventually. Just like we knew he would.

And now that we know Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and Venom actually got transported to the MCU from their universe before getting transported back and leaving some of his symbiote behind, we can assume we'll see Tom don the Symbiote Suit at one point. And it's stated that symbiotes have multiverse knowledge, this Venom could somehow remember joining with Tobey's Spider-Man and, wanting to go back to that, join with Tom's. It's so fucking exciting, and if done right, if done like this film, could be fucking revolutionary and I'm all for it.

T.L;D.R: Tom's character is going to be a lot less like Iron Man Jr. and more like Spider-Man in the next trilogy.

What do you guys think? Did you love this film as much as I did? Let me know.",Marvel,Only click if you've seen No Way Home

Spidermen, Symbiotes, Hulks, Wolverine, Deadpool, Punisher, Daredevil, Moon Knight, Ghost Rider,

Defenders, X Force, X Men, Avengers,

I know this is a lot to ask but it would be great to know if it exists before I try to somehow create such a list without reading anything. No spoilers please and thanks.",Marvel,Any such thing as a massive comprehensive reading order?
Film/Television,False,"Steven annoys me. He’s obviously in danger and doesn’t allow Marc to help him at all until the very end me. I get that being possessed sucks and wanting answers is normal, but you’re being chased by people who are trying to murder you. Deal with the problem now then ask questions later.",Marvel,Moon Knight annoyance
Other,False,"Right up front: I want them so I can use them as authoritative sources I can pull concrete details for media criticism, not for collectible value or resale.

I’m writing an extended essay about a specific character, and I wanted to get the manuscripts for the MCU projects he appears in so I can get the full context of their character narratives and representation on-screen.

I’ll even take a bootleg Xerox. I’m literally only using them the way you would use a textbook so I can properly contextualize my analysis.

But do you guys know any other collection better than that one?",Marvel,"I need help from the ""marvel stuff collectors"""
Film/Television,False,"Why does Sabertooth seem super different, and there's no chemistry between him and Wolverine in the original X-Men trilogy, despite them being brothers and such as explained in Origins: Wolverine? Or is that movie just...kinda a what if and not canon?",Marvel,Why does Sabertooth and Wolverine seem to not have a history anymore?
Other,False,"Like a character with one leg or arm? 

I think it would give more meaning to representation in films, so instead of just replacing a character with a women or black person, it would give that character more of a challenge and character development while it wouldn’t be geared to liking the character just based off their gender and race.


I think it would present more of a challenge for the character that will equate to more compassion and at the same time would represent people with disability’s",Marvel,Is there a disable character in marvel?
Comics ,False,"I heard marvel never reboots does that mean marvel Golden age, silver age and bronze comic's are connected and continued to till now.

Maybe I’m just dumb but can someone explain it to me please.,Marvel,Can someone explain to me why Vulcan is a villain?
Film/Television,False,So i saw a video where someone said the reason thanos lost was the way he changed his perspective. But itsnt that complete bullshit? The reason thanos lost in the 1 scenario is because strange gives him the time stone freely? Because there are 2 things following on that. 1. The ancoent one gives the avengers the time stone because strange did give it to thanos. Stark survives and so is possible to solve the problem of time travelling.ä,Marvel,reason why thanos lost
Film/Television,False,"in the original comics he becomes the hobgoblin  and in no way home there is a sewing machine there is gold and green the colors of hobgoblin not only that in any other multi verse the close friend of Spiderman always becomes green goblin, electro etc. He is also working out in MIC for some un known reason i think its pretty clear. it always happens soon after the person there close with dies so i think that it will most likely happen if not i think that ned as a character would just go to waste",Marvel,do you think Ned Leeds will be hobgoblin in the next spider man movie

I bet people asked this question before but I'll still ask it. You see, there's that collar things in Genosha episode(we also see them in Deadpool 2). When a mutant wears this collar, it disables the mutant powers. So why don't they just remove the explosive in that collar and make it little fashionable so Rogue can wear it to be ""normal""? Sometimes she thinks her powers are a curse. So I think she can use such a device to enjoy life a little.",Marvel,Been watching X-men TAS lately and I have a question about Rogue

Other,False,"First off, I was wildly entertained by the movie and had a lot of fun watching it. If you haven’t watched it, it’s a must watch for any Spidey or Marvel fan. 

So what’s my unpopular opinion? It was poorly written with so many things that didn’t make sense. So many questions of why a character did something (or didn’t do something) that is so out of character. The whole movie and the problems that the main characters face could have been so easily prevented, but instead it’s like they took crazy pills. It seems like poor writing like this is always tied to the movies that come from Sony. Even the Venom movies (which I also love) makes you question so many thing and ask why constantly. Anywho, I just see Sony attached to the movie and have to turn off the switch for my logical brain so it doesn’t interfere or question what is happening, and just sit back and watch some cool action and CGI from characters I love. Sony is lucky they have such important and popular characters to jump on board and cash in on Marvel mania.

Film/Television,False,"I’ve seen some speculation that Jake Lockley has been subtly referenced in Disney+’s Moon Knight.

Other,False,"[Joe Casey is the latest in a string of creators](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/marvel-america-chavez-doctor-strange-2-1235126888/) whose work has been adapted to the screen. 

I know that legally, these days when creators work for IP comics publishers, they do not own the rights to any new characters they create. It is all owned by the corporation. But my question isn't about what is legal, it is what is fair. 

Especially when our conception of a comic book character are seldom the efforts of a single person. For instance, let's take **Wolverine**:

* **Roy Thomas** asked Len Wein to create a character named Wolverine, who should be Canadian, small of stature, with a fierce temper.
* **John Romita** created the initial character design
* **Len Wein** wrote Wolverine's first appearances
* **Herb Trimpe** drew his first appearances
* **Gil Kane** tweaked that cowl in Giant-Size X-Men
* **Chris Claremont** wrote the majority of his character development, established the claws are part of him and not his gloves in the pages of Uncanny X-Men
* **Dave Cockrum** gave Logan that distinctive hairstyle (cribbed from DC Legionnaire Timber Wolf)
* **John Byrne** collaborated in the storytelling and designed the brown &amp; tan costume
* **Frank Miller** collaborated with Claremont to establish his samurai background
* **Barry Windsor Smith** wrote and drew the Weapon X storyline
* **Joe Quesada, Paul Jenkins and Bill Jemas** collaborated in crafting his long-awaited ""Origin""

So simply being the first person to introduce a character is not necessarily the best indicator as to who is responsible for that character. Or to be more straightforward, when you think of Daredevil, do you think that character to be the product of Stan Lee and Bill Everett — or Frank Miller?

In this case, should Joe Casey's amount be more or less than Kieron Gillen's, whose work on Young Avengers developed the character, made the character break through and got her some attention?

And I'm assuming its also relevant how important is America Chavez actually is to the Doctor Strange movie in the first place? How much screen time does she have? Is she central to the plot or a cameo?

*(Also, it should be said, Joe isn't working on the movie — he's collecting passive income. I ONLY mention this because there are a lot of people who bust their ass on the crew and in effects houses who are also underpaid. But I know underpaying one group is no excuse for underpaying another. But I think it does provide some perspective in how much who deserves what.)*

And not for nothing — not knowing what was offered isn't helping things either. Only one side tends to talk when these stories come up and we never know what the amount even is. So we just take it on faith that its as insulting and pathetic as they say it is. I know its super easy to take the side of the creators over the multinational IP corporations — who have always dicked over ever since Jerry and Joe came up with Superman. 

I'm right there with you. I root for the little guy and fairness is a core value of mine.

But when I try to create a hypothetical thought experiment, presuming DisneyMarvel actually DOES want to do right by the comic creators I can't for the life of me figure out how to even calculate that. 

So how would ***YOU*** calculate what is owed to comic creators who know they don't have IP ownership on the characters that get adapted to other media?",Marvel,How do you calculate what is owed to comic creators when their work is adapted to other media?

Plus Penance is just freaking cool, the concept and background and everything. That’s really what I’m getting at I guess. The poor guy really tortures himself and feels accountable, but it’s obviously not hard to understand why. This is the kind of stuff I think the MCU should focus on. Yeah they’re working towards obscure characters, but they aren’t taking any care to portray them as they are, they’re tweaking them to be more palatable to modern audiences, or what they perceive to be more palatable (or profitable, as it more likely is). I’ll admit I know nothing about Moon knight other than he was one of my favorites in ultimate alliance because he looked so cool but it sounds like the new show is exactly this - sure it exposes a lot of people to the character, theoretically, and it sounds like it’s well made but it also sounds like it doesn’t REALLY show who the character is. And the philosophy seems to be “well, no one knows these guys, no one will care, comic fans will just be happy we’re even acknowledging them”. But I digress.

Comics ,False,"tl;dr: I was caught completely by surprise by the recent changes to the digital copy system and suddenly I have a ton of random holes in my digital library b/c they decided to expire the copies early for some reason. Anyone else?

Pardon me for telling a story here, but I really hope Marvel sees this and reverses course on this ASAP.

So, personal preference, but I actually prefer to keep my library digital. I originally started buying Marvel b/c they came with a digital copy. Marvel is the only thing I still buy in light of the disastrous changes Comixology has seen lately, because I can keep buying at my local store and redeem copies to my digital library.

Then sometime late last year I guess, they changed the digital copy program: some issues (not all, w/ no rhyme or reason governing which ones) don't have a sticker anymore. You can still get a digital copy, but they now make people snap a picture of the comic to submit, have a turn around time of up to two weeks, must be submitted one at a time, and most troubling of all, have had the expiration dates shorted from a year+ to mere weeks.

Compare this to the old system, where the stickers weren't 100% foolproof, but they were backed up by terrific customer support when things went wrong.

But more importantly, you could redeem multiple comics at once in a simple web form instead of jumping through hoops for every single comic in the new system.

But MOST importantly, you had the breathing room that you could save up months of comics at a time to redeem all at once. If you're used to this, it's very disturbing to suddenly find that random comics not only require extra steps, but have long since expired.

My best guess is this is meant to be some kind of new anti-piracy initiative, but in my experience the best way to fight piracy is by making things more convenient, not less. Plus by applying it to new comics seemingly randomly... just why???

Shouldn't they be together? ""But everyone knows who the X-Men are, so it's different."" I'm sure there are still plenty of people who don't know who the X-Men are. They might feel the same way you did watching Eternals. And the MCU usually makes its characters a little different than in the comics. Do we need a series to explore each X-Men member's personality? If not, why do the Eternals need it? Should there have been a series for Guardians of the Galaxy, too? For all we know, the X-Men movie will suck, and we will appreciate Eternals for how it handled the introduction of so many characters.",Marvel,Why is the Eternals movie hated for the same reason people want an X-Men movie?
Comics ,False,"I’ve been wanting to check out the character for a while ever since I played Web of Shadows when I was a little kid. Was thinking I should start with some stuff to kinda get a general idea of the character. Some of the werewolf stuff seems cool and I’m pretty sure his first appearance was fighting them. I also wanted to read his origin/origins. And then I kinda just wanted to read stuff that looked cool after that. If there’s a good story that gives you the essentials of the character that would be cool. Like something that gives you a good idea of what the world and his personality (personalities) are like. And another reason I wanted to try reading some of his stuff was because I heard it’s usually darker than what you usually think of with Marvel, and I heard there’s some horror, which I always like. The mythology aspect also seems cool. And the psychological stuff. But overall the character just seems really interesting. If there was ever an animated series or game that was really good, drop a comment about that too. I’m probably gonna avoid the new show cause from what I’ve heard from people who actually like Moon Knight, it doesn’t really get the character right so far",Marvel,Where should I start with Moon Knight?

Comics ,False,I just finished the Brother Voodoo Marvel Masterworks but that only covers up until 1988. Where do I go from here. He's slowly becoming one of my favorite Horror Heros and I need more to read.,Marvel,Brother Voodoo Suggestion
Film/Television,False,"I was reading [this article](https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/what-if-season-finale-lost-gamora-episode-explained/) about the missing ""What If"" episode with Gamora from the finale - obviously I was puzzled by her inclusion and thought I'd skipped something, but as the article states, the episode got chopped due to covid and will appear in season 2. 

The thing that really stood out for me, however, was this bit: 

**""After so many episodes of Stark being killed, the Watcher understands that you can’t lose if you don’t play. So there’s your surviving Iron Man in the multiverse, getting benched.""**

Iron Man being dead in every timeline makes sense, since RDJ is done - with all the multiversal shenanigans they're cooking up, a"" where's Tony?"" question would be understandable - this is their way of explaining why he won't be making an appearance. 

**Or will he?** See, the Watcher DOES make a point of excluding Tony here, which means that Sakaarian Iron Man is still around. Furthermore, he's seen The Watcher, which could believeably lead to him investigating/learning more about the multiverse. 

Marvel LOVES to surprise people, even going as far as having actors lie repeatedly (no one will ever believe Andrew Garfield again), and they've shown they're willing to go pretty far outside the main timeline, even outside the FRANCHISE, since Tobey, Andrew, and even Tom Hardy's Venom are all technically canon now, albeit from other universes (hell, The Defenders are even official canon in the MAIN universe now). 

Given all that, plus how strong fan response is for Iron Man, I'd bet a non-trivial amount of money that we're going to see Sakaarian Iron Man show up in the nick of time at some point during the multiverse war/Kang the Conquerer arc in phase 5. They've basically spent all of phase 4 setting that up, so presumably phase 5 is where it'll all really hit the fan, and I'm betting Iron Man shows up right near the end, when things are at their most desperate. Sure, RDJ is ""done"" with the role, but I think it would be very in character for both RDJ AND Marvel to bring him back for a limited engagement, and I think Sakaarian Iron Man is how they're going to do it. 

Yes, I know he's repeatedly said he's definitely finished, but again, we know for a fact that they lie. I wouldn't even be surprised if this is already a signed deal and his denials are intentional misdirection designed to squash potential future leaks. You just wait: we're going to see a very recognizable silhouette come walking out of the fog to save the day sometime late in phase 5. Hell, the fact that he's dead in almost every timeline might well be the REASON he's able to save the day - something like Kang knows he's supposedly gone from the multiverse, which enables him to pull a surprise move in a way that others can't. 

Leave a comment to let me know what you think, if you have an alternate theory, or how stupid and wrong I am (and how bad I should feel about that fact).",Marvel,iron Man in phase 5?

Film/Television,False,"After watching episode 2, Moon Knight doesn't remind me of Venom nor Batman, it actually remind me of Batman too but it reminded me of Dr. Fate. More, Let's start looking at similarities(I haven't read moon Knight comics btw)

Kent Nelson(avatar of Nabu aka Dr. Fate) &amp; Every avatar of Khonsu so far
Kent Nelson is an archeologist, Steven Grant isn't one but he study Archeology, Kent Nelson have a wife that has been through adventures with him and so does marc, Arthur has the order symbol on his arm and has a magical staff, Kent Nelson is an Agent of Order and also has a magical staff.

If that's not enough similarities for you then let's go for the next one's

Nabu &amp; Khonsu
They're both deities, they both need an avatar to do justice, they both have multiple successors, &amp; they both want justice.

Dr. Fate &amp; Moon Knight
They both have enhanced strength, they both have super suits, &amp; they both are controlled by multiple characters.

khonsu seemed interested at Marcs wife being his next avatar which reminded me that Kent Nelson wife also became Dr. Fate.

Comics ,False,"Hey All,

I know this is a frequently asked thing and i think i have a good understanding, but people say different things, so it gets a little confusing.

I just want to confirm from people who have read it that i can read Hickman’s marvel saga in omnibus format. I'm not bothered about secret warriors and S.H.E.I.L.D and the other non omni collected stuff.

So my question is to ask is my understanding of the reading order below correct and the books are mapped correctly with all the interlocking tittles. Will I get the story as a whole (like I said not too bothered about missing minor character stories and stuff).

I think I know enough about prior stuff like Makers story and stuff like that to just go in. 
I think I I also need to read original sin as I don’t think its collected in the below?

Hickman FF omnibus volume 1

Other,False,Does anyone else think that marvel adding more gay characters could be the end of marvel? marvel keeps trying ot add more gay characters and so far it hasn't been working out (case in point: Eternals which got the lowest rotten tomatoes score of all mcu films) and swapping genders ( Taskmaster from Blackwidow) i mean taskmaster was a major disappointment because of how much of a fan favorite character he was in the comics and the film was a major let down of his character. Disney came out and said that they are gonna make half of there characters gay which also probably includes marvel (bc disney owns marvel). I do think that marvel might be in danger of ruining themself with all these gay characters and gender swaps. I mean there are plently of unused good girl villans from the classic comics like titana that would be better than ruining some classic characters. I wanna know what you guys think.,Marvel,The End of Marvel Studios
Film/Television,False,"Unless this was intentional, why was this green lighted? Her accent is so inconsistent with so many words enunciated so bizarrely.

Especially would love some info on what the show calls Khonshu's ""avatars"" Moon Knight and Mr Knight, which seem to be attached to each personality as opposed to being interchangeable. The series is confusing intentionally and maybe some of this will be explained, but initially I expected the character to just jump back and forth between different people (Marc, Steven and Jake) with Moon Knight and Mr Knight being carried between them, but so far thats not how it is playing out.

I am not sure on the lore, but I am aware that some higher-order beings influence the purpose of lower-order beings by making them avatars, among other things. I am wondering if someone/something chooses or decides on who a nexus being will be in each universe and who will replace them if they die. I am not aware of any info on this, but since magic was created along with the 5th cosmos (??), it could be a multiversal law introduced around this time by the incarnation of that cosmos and the ones succeeding it? 

I also like to think that the-one-above-all personally selects these individuals, similar to the-one-below-all creating avatars through extreme gamma radiation. This might not hold up though as the-one-above-all is meant to be a light version of the-one-below-all, so the creation of evil or morally unsound nexus beings doesn’t really fit the theme. However, if we weren’t thinking in a binary way, the two extremes can be combined to form an array of orientations of the one-above/below-all and hence decide to create nexus beings.

Film/Television,False,"Morbios is an absolutely genius experience only true enlightened viewers could even begin to comprehend, the way the protagonist, John Morbius, has to deal with his crippling gay hentai addiction while at the same time dealing with the absolutely amazing villain, Man Spider (Who I will get to praising soon enough), is truly artful and extremely relatable to all who see it. John Morbin is a realistic depiction of the 21st century american business man, he is trapped in a job he despises and is bogged down by his parents' (Joe and Jill Morbian) unrealistic expectations of him in a society that will not forgive a single mistake. That's not even to speak of his only true companion, his brother, Josh Morgiol. The way the two interact with eachother and discuss their intricate and complex relationship is truly enchanting. Capitalism. Before I get to praising what is undoubtebly the greatest antagonist in all of human literature, I must talk about the excellently choreographed fight scenes. The way the morgol twins brutally slaughter their opponents in vicious combat proves just how powerful they are and the lengths they are willing to go to in order to defend themselves, proving how comitted they are as heroes with no one truly understanding their struggle. However, when Man Spider enters the film and utterly decimates Josh mongrol, taking his life and gravely wounding John, I was devastated. The bond between the two brothers was so deep I believed not even a film of this caliber would be willing to kill one off. This is when I realized this film transcended the boundaries of what was thought to be possible in conventional media and had something truly profound to say about life, I believe if Vladimir Putin were to watch this modern day masterpiece he would immediately withdraw from Ukraine, the film is simply that powerful. Now, I will discuss the greatest antagonist in all of literature, Man Spider. The way he jumps into the narrative and rips away our one true companion is devastating, but once you find out his tragic history and ultimate ambitions, you begin to understand and even sympathize with his struggle. When we first learned about his only friend, Uncle Neb and how he was so cruelly ripped away from this earth it brought back the scene of Josh being killed by Man, this showed how Man Spider had descended from his former glory into one he would hate. Previously, characters such as ""Griffith"" and ""Joker (dark  knight)"" were thought to have been some of the best antagonists in modern fiction, but with the realease of this masterpiece, we have a new king of antagonists, utterly destroying the competition. This film is truly incredible and all living (and even non living) humans must see it as soon as possible.",Marvel,Morbius is a cinematic masterpiece and far away the greatest film ever created

They were engadged, and they were supposed to get married, when they were done with new mexico, but then shit went down, and Clint is heartbroken, when he finds small post-it notes with something like
 ""We're out of milk. Can you stop by the store?  ~ C.B.""
or something like that. 
The C was for Coulson and the B for Barton  (Phil Coulson-Barton and Clint Barton-Coulson). 

Phil knew how much Clint was looking forward to get married, so he left little notes like that all over the house. 

I don't remember what happened next, but Clint might've cried himself to sleep, or drank too much, and pass out, but he woke up to find Phil alive and kicking in their home. I think Clint thought he was dead, or Phil was just a hallucination at first.

They talked things through, and ended up cuddling in bed, or something, and Phil was surprised when Clint kept the little notes, saying he couldn’t throw them away. He couldn’t throw a piece of Phil away, or something like that.

Clint then asked something like if they werd still doing the B part, in which Phil replied with either ""yes"", a kiss, or both.

Film/Television,False,"(I do want to point out that my recent viewing of the films I was high while watching it so my perspective might be skewed)

I can admit that the movie's low points are REALLY low. Some of the character designs in the sequel are just... bad, most notably Electro (whose design was fixed in No Way Home) and Green Goblin. A couple of the plot points are just kinda weird, like the whole plot line surrounding Peter's father and Harry needing an antidote for his family's disease. As well as the pacing seemed kinda off throughout the films.

But I believe the films' high points are really high. I do think the casting choices were done really well. Garfield just oozes charisma and does a really great job at portraying Peter. Garfield and Stone have great chemistry and are the best part about these films is whenever they're on screen together. Dane DeHann is definitely an under appreciated casting choice for Harry, especially if you look at the tone of the films and what they were trying to accomplish with his character. Sally Field does a good job as May and definitely seems to be in the right age range for her compared to her MCU and Raimi counterparts. Rhys Ifans and Martin Sheen are good in their roles. Jamie Foxx seems to be the only odd ball but his performance was fine with what he was given.

The action in this movie is stunning. The fights with Electro keep you on the edge of your seat and also keep you excited, especially with the dubstep music in his fights. Parker's fights with the Lizard aren't quite as good but are still fun and entertaining. The only fight that is held back is the fight against the Goblin. 

The reasoning as why the villians are villains seem valid enough and make sense. Electro feels betrayed by Spider-Man, Goblin wants to cure his disease, Lizard wants the human race to exceed by combining their DNA with Lizard DNA. Even the police focus more on the legal side of vigilantism and are against him until the end of the first film. 

Some of the small things they did too I think are really nice too. I can appreciate them taking a different approach to Peter Parker, instead of being the nerdy kid everyone knows, he is kinda seen as an outsider but has a similar personality than other iterations. They make Gwen competent and capable of doing things that are actually useful to Spider-Man instead of being the damsel in distress.

Comics ,False,"Hey, so....  Does anyone else think it's pretty sick how Reed and Sue Richards let their daughter hang out with a mass murderer?  Is it just me, or is this really, **really** twisted?

Look, I know he helped with Val's birth.  But we're talking about a man who brutalized her brother while wearing the skin of a woman he flayed alive.  He's committed practically every war crime imaginable and probably invented a dozen new ones.  He literally removed his ability to feel guilt with a magic spell.  He has tried very hard to torture the Fantastic Four to death on numerous occasions, and he will absolutely try again.

And yet, he's a friend of the family?  They go to his wedding?  They give him play dates with their little girl?  I know that Reed has a soft spot for his old college buddy, but....  Good lord.  I'm kind of sick of hearing him whine about how he hopes his poor old friend will turn over a new leaf.  People who get caught handling drugs in the wrong place get **years** in prison.  Meanwhile Doctor Doom orders his butler to kill the hostages in his dungeons because he's tired of experimenting on their brains, and then Mr. Fantastic heals his ugly face for the twelfth time because, darn it, he's not gonna give up on the old rascal.  How much fun did Reed have with Victor in college that he's still this damn nice to the monstrous bastard??  It must have been the greatest bromance in history.

And it's not just Reed, either.  This seems to affect most other heroes, to varying degrees.  Did you see the last Iron Man arc?  Tony gets cosmic and briefly goes mad with power.  His allies ask Doctor Doom to come and help stop him (casual as you please, because nobody's terribly bothered by asking a genocidal dictator for a favor), and it doesn't work, and Tony rampages a bit before he un-murders everyone and de-cosmifies himself and apologizes to all involved.

So.... Are we just forgetting that Doctor Doom murdered a hojillion people? That whole, entire universe that he slaughtered because he didn't like the looks of it, just a couple of years ago?  Tony knows this.  He went there and learned the truth of this horrific apocalypse, and he seems really upset about it for a page or two, but then....  I guess he stops caring. What, Doom gets to cruise back to his castle, same as always, and Tony doesn't feel like doing anything about that? Doesn't zap the worst mass murderer in history before he farts away the power cosmic?  Doesn't drag him to the Marvel Hague, or cut his mind in half?  Doesn't even say anything?  Well, no, he says *something*.  He says, ""No hard feelings.""

**NO HARD FEELINGS**.

In the recent history of Marvel, the only superhero who ever seemed to really hold this sociopath to task was Scott Lang.  Doom murdered Cassie, his daughter (before she came back to life), and Scott found him and beat the ever-loving crap out of him.  He dismantled his powers, and his armor, and his ego, and humiliated him in front of the Latverian people.  And it was extremely cathartic, but of course it doesn't actually change anything in the long run.  Val still gave her Uncle Victor a hug at the end of the day and tried to make him feel better, because most other super-people tend to treat Doom more like a gruff uncle than a blood-soaked fascist.

And I gotta say, with all the evil dictators in real life, it depresses me to know that even in a fantasy world the rich and powerful can still get away with anything.  Through politics or influence or corruption, the most awful villains remain comfortably insulated from any lasting form of Earthly justice, and all is forgiven in time because he's somehow on good terms with the only ones who can hold him accountable.  It just seems too sadly realistic.

Other,False,"Morbius, the living vampire, is a Spider-Man character i knew little of. I knew of him through media like the Ultimate Spider-Man series and his appearance in the Spider-Man 3 video game. 

Jared Leto did a good job with Morbius, far better than his character in Bladerunner and as Joker. He brought all he could for a character who knows he's close to death and is trying to find a cure for his disease. I'm thankful he's not an early 2000s brutting hero, he adds some needed humor but knows when to get serious.

The plot definitely needed some improvements in areas like the romance. But its an action hero, origin movie, romance is a side thing 

The action and demonstration of powers were really engaging, especially for a vampire themed character. 

The villain is understandable in his motives. Some say he went overboard on his reasonings, but in our world, if you push a person too far, they start shootings so not that far fetched

End credits...you'll have to see yourselves. I don't know what Sony is doing 

Overall I'd give the movie a fair 7/10

Film/Television,False,What if (no pun) phase 1-3 had tv shows and side stories like they do now. I wonder how the mcu would have been if the started this stuff years ago.,Marvel,What if the MCU..
Film/Television,False,"After the spell was redone to have everyone forget would Tony stark forget him to? I know at this point he is dead but given that we have Thor, odin, Valhalla, and Hela who runs hel, and even stuff like the soul stones inner world, I would say we know there is an after life in the MCU, so my question is, now would Tony stark forget Peter? Who he treated like a son??

Or is this just not possible??",Marvel,question about the end of Spiderman no way home

Comics ,False,"Under the original Copyright Act of 1908, copyright only extended to 28 years after creation and an additional 28 years with renewal for 56 years total. Under the current copyright laws this duration is instead extended to 95 years after creation. 

As copyright expires and characters/stories enter public domain it isn't all at once. Only the stories, names, and character elements introduced in that specific year open up.

For example, because Amazing Fantasy #15 was released in 1962, in this alternate 2018 only the elements in that specific comic (names, costume, characters) would be available for anyone to use and publish for profit. If they wanted to use Mary Jane they would have to wait until 2023 because she wasn't introduced in the comics until 1967. Similarly Venom wasn't introduced until 1988 and subsequently wouldn't be available until 2044 in the public domain.

But... what would Marvel have done with all of their classic characters entering the public domain? If any comic company could not only republish ASM#15 but also make up their own stories using the names and appearances. Would we have seen major changes to classic characters to differentiate them from their earlier incarnations? Would we have seen the wholesale abandonment of older characters in favor of legacy characters created very recently? 

Would we have seen multiple studios announcing movies and TV series featuring the Ditko era Spider-Man starting this year?

Also on the DC side, pretty much all of their Golden Age characters would have been in public domain for years starting with Action Comics #1 (1994) and Detective Comics #27 (1995), with the silver age elements and characters starting to enter public domain at the same time as Marvel's.

Pre-Avengers Captain America would've entered public domain in 1997, as would characters like Namor in 1995, and the Human Torch (Jim Hammond) in 1995.

So how do you all think this would've impacted Marvel media, how would Marvel have adapted and how would it have shaped the landscape of superhero media?",Marvel,What If... Disney never successfully lobbied Congress to increase copyright duration in 1976 and 1998 and Marvel Comics biggest characters had started to enter public 56 years after their debuts?

Film/Television,False,"So I was giving Hulk 2003 another chance in my Marvel Cinematic Multiverse Marathon leading up to Multiverse Of Madness.

So the movie isn't great, I won't even say good. But there's an oddly charming, sad, creepy and tragic mood to it and its story. The Danny Elman Score and the bizarre editing really actually give it its borderline disturbing charm. Really, the story of Bruce Banner in this universe is just tragic. His father was an interestingly sick man, and deems the Hulk his ""real"" son, the real creation. 

In fact, minus a few moments, this Hulk isn't particularly portrayed as heroic. In fact all he has is Betty Ross. The whole in-the-mirror puny human line, hints at a hatred brewing for humanity. Bruce actually seems to use the Hulk against People in the end scene.

I feel like the tragic-ness of this version of Hulk would actually be a perfect set up for him to eventually be the REAL monster as his father seemed to believe, the Maestro. Perhaps in that reality, the puny humans got Betty killed and Hulk became unstoppable. There were no other heroes to stop him here. Maestro in the comics isn't from the mainstream 616 reality so it would actually make sense.

As flawed a movie as it is, I think the story of Eric Bana Hulk is actually perfect for Maestro.",Marvel,Eric Bana's Hulk should be Maestro

Venom can be presumed to take place in 2018 and Let There Be Carnage probably about a year later. Although it doesn’t matter to the overall plot, did anyone pick up any context clues that might clue in to what year it takes place in that universe?

Film/Television,False,"Everything I've seen online bashes the film. I went in with low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. It was fast paced; zero unnecessary scenes. The action was solid. Morbius himself was well done. Jared Letto did a great job. The villain wasn't spectacular but he worked; they did a good job making them evenly matched with similar abilities.  I'd give the movie a comfortable B+ or A-. It is definitely not the best Marvel movie, but it was definitely worth seeing.

MoM will end with Wanda disappearing, similar to HoM, Hulkling will be introduced in secret invasion/ the Marvels and Cassie Lang will be given a big role in Ant man 3 completing the Young avengers roster. 

Doom will be introduced in F4 (Spider-Man will also make an appearance in F4.) in a post credit scene (or he’ll be the main villain in the film.)  with Wanda. Teasing Children’s crusade where they all come together and introduce patriot. Wanda will then go off afterwards and team up with Agatha in House of Harkness. 

In between all this X-men will be introduced in some form, and in she Hulk will also disappear or just be sent off with a reason to hate earths hero’s. Setting up for a WWH vs the F4 x-men and avengers whatever they turn out to be. 



I can also see a Wolverine TV show because tell me that wouldn’t shoot subscribers to the moon and a Wiccan+Hulkling D+ series to flesh out the characters post Children’s crusade because they don’t have to worry about censors as much and they can keep all that gay stuff out of the films while still giving them the relationship. 

Spider-Man will fight scorpion while teaming up with Black cat and getting the black suit in film 1. Film 2 could be absolutely anything. And film 3 will be a massive team up event with DD, black cat, maybe even moonknight etc just all the street tiers vs Kingpin and some master plan he has, in this Miles will also be introduced and Peter will die or fuck off somewhere. Also I believe secret wars will be somewhere in between this MAYBE.

Film/Television,False,"Just got out of Morbius. I think Sony's problem with their approach to superhero movies is their reliance on formulaic writing. Morbius is an okay movie. Jared Leto is pretty good, the effects were awesome, the exterior shots in both Costa Rica and New York were pretty awesome. It's the script that sucks. The story is same old. The best friend is the villain, the hero believes he's a monster, everything happens as it ""should"".

So of course Spidey jumped in and saved the day. But at the  end is the weird part. So the party was in a fire hall or club or one of those places where they let you use their building for parties. So MJ somehow got locked into the freezer in the kitchen area. I heard her scream and there were zapping sounds. Then she like breaks the freezer door down. She comes out and from her body is the type of steam you see when you breathe out in cold air. So I guess MJ has ice powers now and she just calls herself Frost.

Comics ,False,"The Crucible first appeared in X-men 7 where it was explained that there was a fear that a million mutants might kill themselves in the hope of being resurrected. It was explained that resurrecting this many mutants was not possible. The Five literally cannot do it. Resurrection is a process and there are limits to how much work the Five can do.

Thus the Crucible. Terrible and beautiful, resurrection as a mutant must be earned.

Trail of Magneto 5 added every dead mutant ever to the queue. It then explained that now people had an alternative to the Crucible. They could go into the ""waiting room"" Wanda created and wait for resurrection.

But how does this solve the issue the Crucible was created for?

If anything it seems like the Five now have to be more picky with who they resurrect as there are so many possibilities. Going into the waitng room puts a mutant at the back of a list so long it will never be completed. It seems that the Crucible is more necessary than ever.

Film/Television,False,"They'll never properly utilize this massive cast as-is, and before phase 4 is over, we're getting at least 5 new heroes or hero groups (Jane Foster as Thor, Ms. Marvel, the Eternals, She-Hulk, Fantastic Four)

And first off, that's cool. We're getting a lot of characters. But unlike comics, actors get older and decide to move onto different projects. So here's my (not even remotely comprehensive) list of characters that exist in the MCU, have superpowers, and haven't had a movie or a starring role in a series, or who became a reformed villain and disappeared off the face of the earth never to emerge again.

I'm nearly up to date with the MCU, but I still haven't seen Thor 1, Captain Marvel, Black Widow, or Spider Man: No Way Home. I'm getting there.

Monica Rambeau (from Captain Marvel and Wandavision)

Ghost (from Ant Man and the Wasp)

Black Knight (from Eternals)

The Midnight Sons (from Eternals)

Scorpion (from Spider Man: Homecoming)

Adam Warlock (hinted at in Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2)

The Ravagers (from Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2)

Martinex (from Guardians of the Galaxy volume 2)

Valkrie (from Thor 3)

Zhang Meng Er (from Shang Chi, though she was like the 5th or 6th most important character in that one, so it's not like she was totally irrelevant.)

Probably others but my brain ran out of RAM trying to come up with more MCU characters that I may or may not have seen for the last time already. I took a look back at phases 1 and 2, and while I think storytelling has improved a lot since then, I think the dramatic moments they achieved were due to long term character investment by a global audience, and I think as more and more characters are introduced, we start to lose track of who's who. If any given one of the eternals doesn't show up in the next movie and it's a good movie, I don't think anyone will throw a fuss over continuity, but imagine Jane Foster getting replaced in phase 1! That would have been absolutely crazy!

So yeah. I like superhero movies. But the benefit of the MCU is that I see the heroes again and again, so seeing these characters once is kind of a pain. I wanna know how they interact with other characters!",Marvel,The MCU needs to stop introducing new characters

He claims that when Morbius says ""I am Venom,"" he could see a poster in the background with Andrew's Spider-Man with the caption ""Murderer,"" likely due to him no longer pulling his punches. During the post credit scenes, as Adrian (Vulture) appears from the MCU Earth (Earth-199999) due to the events of NWH, he claims the reason he is there is due to Spider-Man.

Comics ,False,"I actually don’t even really care for him that much, but you can’t ignore his influence and presence. First off he was pretty much THE very first Marvel metahuman. But the intriguing part about him is how tumultuous and unpredictably predictable is. He does as he sees fit for Atlantis, but that’s made him wind up on all sorts of sides. Even in Atlantis he can be a douchey ruler. What inspired me to make this post in fact was realizing he was both in the Illuminati and the cabal. If you know about those two groups it says a crap ton about the kind of character he is. And I think his connections to the FF and X-men are equally fascinating, in conjunction with his long-standing history as I mentioned, seeing as how if I understand correctly, Spider-Man, the FF and the X-men were Marvel’s best performing titles in the 60s and that set them up to be massive influences in the marvel universe. I mean think of all the cosmic and world threatening villains the FF and X-men introduced, as well as the scope of their rosters and all the important events they were part of. Sure the avengers probably outdo them by now but honestly not that much relative to all the other marvel titles published over the years. And then you figure how easily Namor can mess up both those groups when he shows up, not even in a fight but even emotionally just by being there because no one usually knows why and it can throw people off their game. 

I understand it probably had something to do with rights and popularity or lack thereof at first. And there’s the fact the medium will just never lend itself to the same kind of long form stories comics can, though the MCU has still been pretty revolutionary in that respect. But let’s put it this way, in a just world Namor would have gotten a movie before the eternals or guardians of the galaxy. Frankly even a cameo in a WWII Captain America movie (maybe not necessarily TFA because I don’t know how that’d work) would’ve been cool. And again, honestly I don’t even like him that much, but he seems to be a very important character.

I almost think if I redid the MCU with marvel having access to all its heroes at the start, I would’ve constructed it so we could arrive at an Illuminati movie or at least their formation in an avengers movie or something, maybe even before infinity war/endgame, and a cabal follow up or standalone movie after. Even if the formation of each change, since the conditions in the comics were the stuff before the civil war and the secret invasion. Let’s just say the characters in those groups are some of the biggest personalities in all the comics, and at the moment, the MCU only has featured 2/6 Illuminati members and 1/6 cabal members (I actually really like the hood and he was relatively important in that specific span of time but you could definitely argue the kingpin or someone like that would fit better in a kind of “all time greatest” cabal. Everyone else would pretty much stay the same though).",Marvel,"It’s kind of crazy Namor isn’t in the MCU yet, or even as big in general as he really should be."

Film/Television,False,"I heard bad things going into the movie, and didn't expect much but was still interested. The only thing I cared about was Morbius himself and how this would maybe connect to NWH - I thought they did good with his character and while the post credits aren't really explained well I'm curious to see how this works in the future.

The villain sucked and the movie is a tad too long, but I didn't hate it. People are tearing it to shreds, but personally Let There Be Carnage should've gotten more slack. Everything with Carnage? Cool. Everything else? Ass. Wonder what some other thoughts are outside of critics and Twitter",Marvel,Morbius Thoughts
Comics ,False,"Hi, long time Moon Knight comics fan here. Despite reading most of his runs post 2000, I've never been able to reach a solid conclusion to this. Sometimes it seems like Moon Knight is an extension of Jake or Marc, sometimes Mr. Knight seems like Steven, sometimes they imply they're both their own fifth and sixth personalities. So is there ever confirmation about this that I simply looked over while reading, or is this yet another aspect of Marc's life that's ambiguous? 
I was hesitant to ask this before since Moon Knight isn't exactly ever present in the cultural zeitgeist, but with Moon Knight getting his own MCU show I figured now would be the best time to ask.",Marvel,"Are Comics Moon Knight/Mr. Knight Seperate From Marc, Steven, and Jake?"
Film/Television,False," It's a bit of an unpopular opinion, especially among the more hard-core MCU fans. No disrespect to them, just recognizing their very deep love for the MCU and how it's been built and I understand the anger at having other Marvel properties being pulled away from the future of the MCU. 

 To the movie: it's a very by the beats movie. It doesn't break any significant new ground in the grand scheme of cinema; its a superhero movie through and through. 

 I admit I did like Jared Leto as Morbius more then I thought I would. Now, before y'all jump on me, I want to state that my liking of his acting ability in this role is not a blanket endorsement of what he has done and still does in his personal life and his treatment of others. 

 The movie didn't spend a lot of time working on building Morbius as a character but we did get to see that as a sick man he is open to pushing the field of science, he does risky things, and does have a strong sense of responsibility for what he has done. Later in the movie, he even creates a suicide drug to kill him and Milo. He sees it as the right thing to do. 

 The problem with this is that there is very little growth for the character. He's already very responsible, works hard to find a cure, and is professional. He is shown to be caring and compassionate to his patients and those around him. He is a good guy. He never really gives into the Vampire side that strongly enough for me to consider it a real struggle in the movie. 

 Milo, on the other hand, is fantastic. We are introduced to him as a sickly child(like Morbius) and is meek in nature. He gets into a fight and we see a brutal anger rise out of him in this fight. A bit of foreshadowing to a darker side? Maybe. 
 
 Matt Smith plays an excellent counter to Jared Leto's character. They both play characters that are sick, have wealth behind them, and remain friends. But we see quickly that Milo is a bit of a cheat when he talks about how he swindled cash out of some Russian mobsters in a card game. He cares little for life when he mentions that the lives Morbius took on the ship can be covered up as they are just guns for hires. 

 Where Morbius cares about others, Milo has a selfish streak and it becomes more and more apparent as he realizes Morbius has the cure. 

 Their dynamic is brilliant and the best part of the movie. The fights are very standard and by the book, nothing glorious or super exciting. Side characters are, well, side characters. A lot of them seem like they'll be more in a sequel but feel more 2D than they should have been. 

 I thought the CGI was really good. Special effects were fun. The pacing was a little fast in spots but never felt like it dragged on.

 For a superhero movie, I give it a solid 3.5 out of 5. It was fun. Entertaining. And that's all that matters. Not worth seeing it again but very well done for a little under 2 hours. 

 Mid-Credits scenes felt like after thoughts and were the worst part of the film imho.",Marvel,Just saw Morbius and liked it! (Spoilers ahead)

Help me oh Redditors! You're my only hope!

I remember very clearly an interview where the lead choreographers for Captain America: The Winter Solider says they sent Chris Evans to ballet classes for the second film. This was responsible for why the choreography and the music fit together so much better in the second film, as now that the main actor was musically trained, the composers and the choreographers could work together on making some truly impressive action-movie fights.

I'm comparing these techniques to things like in DOOM (2016) where the bpm of the songs is often based on the pace of the action taking place on screen, and also briefly referencing the music video industry for the same thing.

Just one thing.

I cannot find any evidence I didn't hallucinate the entire ballet situation.

Comics ,False,"I had me a idea and thought I'd share it here...


I was thinking about what fictional characters, also with meta-awareness, would be a good foil for Deadpool and Alfred E. Newman popped into my head. 

I was imagining an old issue of MAD where Deadpool is lurking in each of the stories, strips, and side panels  offering commentary on the parodies while dealing with how/why he's there and who the omnipresent  big smiling idiot he keeps seeing is. DP could go through a Spy vs. Spy battle, get stuck in Don Martin's Lighter Side, and play with Al Jaffe's gang in the margins all with the different artists take on the character. 

Things would reach a head in the last few pages with a Deadpool movie parody. Deadpool's arc with Alfred E. would be to go from fighting/competing to befriending/becoming with the back cover fold-in  literally turning Deadpool into Alfred E. Newman and vice versa.


In some parallel world I'm sure it was a fun read...

Film/Television,False,"I've never been one for Marvel movies (particularly the Avengers or Spiderman franchises), or superhero movies in general (besides Superman and the Justice League films.) Action and male-dominated storylines have just never appealed to me because I can't relate to them and Marvel has so many intertwining plots. Anyway, I saw Morbius tonight with my boyfriend and a group of his friends, and I honestly loved it. 

As a nineteen year old woman, I grew up loving the Twilight movies - make fun of me all you want; I don't care. They will always be my comfort movies. Morbius intrigued me because it seemed to be the only vampire-centered movie that's been released that isn't Twilight or something of a spinoff of Dracula or Nosferatu. I loved the way the movie was shot, and I especially loved the backstory because it felt personal. I liked the subtle references to Twilight (the painful self restraint Morbius had in order to withhold himself from hurting Martine and that same restraint he used during their kiss on the rooftop), and I loved the power Morbius commanded towards the end of the movie. I like antiheroes...Deadpool, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, Catwoman... etc. Morbius just adds to my list. 

Anyway, I thought it was a great movie for people who don't pick apart every aspect of Marvel movies, and for people who aren't immersed in the Marvel fandom. For people who are into the entire metaverse, I can kinda understand why the movie wouldn't appeal to you, but I really don't get the hate for it.

Film/Television,False,"Now i made a post on this recently on r/marvel studios but I want to go more indepth on what i think would happen if marvel never sold their film rights. So marvel still goes bankrupt but instead of selling their film rights they found Marvel Studios and make their own films, creating the MCU, starting with...

X-Men (2000) Yes this would be the launching point, much like the cartoon was for the MAU, now no changes just yet the film would remain the same, but maybe the end credits scene would feature a tease for the future?

Spider-Man (2002) Once again this would remain the same but maybe a reference to the X-Men in there

Hulk (2002) This is the first one that would change, i imagine there would be pressure to make the films good, to make money, so this is basically just the Incredible Hulk, but with more emphasis on the origin.

Fantastic 4 (2003)

This one would have more actual action in it, Doctor Doom wouldn't be associated with the origin and the movie is about America being at war with Latveria, Doctor Doom still has ties to reed when he was younger, like in the comics.

Daredevil (2003)

Making a movie on Daredevil is a bad idea in my opinion, but they would probably make a movie on him, this would be a more faithful adaptation of Daredevil: The Man Without Fear by Frank Miller, with a Spider-Man reference in there.

X2: Enter the Webhead (2003) Yeah I've heard they wanted to do X-Men meeting Spider-Man, IDK if thats true but i think they'd want to try and cash in on this. So the plot would be: The Setinels are created to hunt down the X-Men and all Mutants after Nightcrawler tried to assasinate the president, meanwhile JJJ prints in the bugle that Spider-Man could be a mutant so Spider-Man is more hated than ever and is being hunted down by the setinels, they almost manage to kill him, but he is saved by the X-Men, now the movie follows the actual X-2 very similarly, Spidey stays at the X-Mansion, and the attack on X-Mansion involves the sentinels. The rest of the movie is pretty much the same but with Spidey. 

The movie ends in a post credit scene with Nick Fury looking at footage of Spider-Man and the X-Men.

Film/Television,False,"So there’s a lot of confusion on which universe the sonyverse is set in and if it is its own established thing or not… but after the post credit scene I’m going to take a logical stab in the dark of which universe I think this occurs in and why 

Personally I think this is set in TASM universe and here’s why 

1. Firstly when the vulture mentions Spider-Man morbius does not question this or ask who that is, implying a Spider-Man is already existing in the universe and has enough popularity to be well known so I would say he’s been around a while 

2. Vulture traveled to the “sonyverse” without a suit and when he meets Morbius he has one… well in the Toby maguire films we never see any form of vulture suit however we do at the end of TASM 2, how a random old dude got his hands on this suit from oscorp who knows maybe oscorp went bankrupt and the technology got moved elsewhere who knows but it would make the most sense that he got the suit from a universe where there already was one rather than he built one from scratch.

3. They seem to be setting up the sinister six with the way Morbius and tombs talk about starting a “group” well this is something already teased at the end of TASM 2 so it would make the most sense to be setting up a sinister 6 in a universe where it was already teased to set up… additionally we already see all the tech at the end of TASM 2

4. At the end of TASM 2 we see suits for rhino, doc ock and vulture, with rhino not really being used much I say he’d be a safe bet to be included in a sinister 6 line up maybe with a better portrayal and more menacing, doctor Octavious would also be fun to see played by a new actor (no offence) although it might be too fresh after seeing him in nwh, the same can be said for the lizard who is still alive in the TASM universe and “cured” possibly based on the events of nwh but I wouldn’t put it past Sony to retcon that and have him try and turn himself into the lizard again hopefully making him more comic accurate and similar to the concept art that was released for nwh but wasn’t followed through with and then vulture and Morbius already established by the film itself this sets up possibly 5 out of the 6 villians the 6th villain could either be someone new that Sony wants to set up, venom which I think would be cool as we may get to see Andrew corrupted by venom for some of the film or Harry Osborn as he is also still alive although I doubt they will go down that road again.

In conclusion I think this makes the most sense of why the Morbius and venom films are set in Andrews universe but who knows, Sony is very messy with what there doing with the their universe right now so who knows all I’m saying is this would be the best way to go about it as well as the funnest and I feel a lot of fans would appreciate it and pay to watch the film as #TASM3 is trending everywhere and it would be a big event that would draw in a lot of money (what studio could turn down a crap ton of money) but yeah that’s what I think, the suits do look very similar for the vulture in morbius and at end of TASM2 so I can hope, thanks for reading 👍",Marvel,Morbius Post Credit Scene (Spoilers Duh)

Film/Television,False,"What an incredible first episode of the new Marvel Disney plus show Moon Knight. This show kicks off with a bang.

The first episode was written by Jeremy Slater, he did an incredible job. I was so fascinated with the different identities of Moon Knight and the character Arthur Harrow, his character is heavily changed from the comic version of him, which I loved. Because I think Arthur in the comics which he's only appeared in one. He is so much better in the show, I loved what the MCU has done to this character. 

In the first episode, we follow the story from the perspective of one of the identifies of Moon Knight which is Steven Grant who is the other side of Marc Spector. Steven Grant is amazing, I love this character. He's so lonely, cute, and sweet. I adored the way Oscar Isaac was playing him, with the weird accent and awkward personality I also feel sad for him I wanted to hug him and be his friend. He's a very nice person who is probably suffering from schizophrenia, because of his other side of him which is Marc Spector. 

Oscar Isaac is an incredible actor he truly did a wonderful job of making me believe that he was dealing with something bad and battling between different identities fighting over the same body. Overall, episode 1 was good, haunting, mesmerizing and a little bit of a thriller. It has a few jump scares in the episode. I thought the story was fantastic and can't wait for it to continue, not a lot of MCU easter eggs, the only real problem with this episode was the length of it. I was mad because I loved this episode, and I was wanting more of it, by the end of it and the episode only felt like it was 30 minutes long. 🤔🤔🤗🤭🙂",Marvel,Moon Knight episode 1 [Spoilers] thoughts

Note as a rule for fun:

* No outside villians masterminding the whole thing if it invalidates the heroes choices.  Tony and Steve still need to be responsible for their own actions
* They have to follow the premise of the conflict, at least vaguely.  I.e Civil War 1 is a new law is enacted that seperates the heroes in half based on response and Civil War 2 is precognition and whether or not we should use it to arrest people or adjust our futures

I think its a fun and creative way to ease the audience into this character without a long episode of Moon knight's origin, it allows us to get to the core concept a lot more quickly and is just great.

Team Affiliations: Irish Rangers, IRA, Brotherhood of Mutants.

Notable Aliases: The Shadow, Mr. Pain, Colin Mulcahey, Thomas Richards, Silas O'Hagan

Abilities: Skilled in guerrilla warfare, military tactics, close quarters combat, marksmanship, demolitions, unarmed combat, expert interrogator, telekinetic probability manipulation.

Biography: Born in Dublin Ireland and trained to be an IRA contract killer after serving in Johannesburg with the Irish Rangers, he was one of the members responsible for the death of Maeve Rourke, putting him into conflict with Black Tom Cassidy and his cousin Sean Cassidy, the Banshee. He killed several low profile mutants, notably the Toad and the Blob.

After he committed these murders, he discovered he had the ability to manipulate outcomes in his favor similar to the Brotherhood of Mutants member Domino. On the run for the murders, he fled to Genosha where he was welcomed by Magneto.

He served as a hired gun for Magneto and formed a familial bond with the other team members, notably forming a romantic relationship with Domino. When Rogue abruptly left the team, Magneto wanted him to kill Rogue, but he refused saying that she was one of them, a hypocritical statement as Magneto pointed out he killed the Blob and Toad.

One night, after he had sex with Domino, he told her he wanted to escape with her and join the X-Men. She agreed after he convinced her that if they did, they would be forgiven for any past crimes. They mad their escape by subduing Quicksilver ans Scarlet Witch. Magneto attempted to stop them, but was wounded when Domino shot him in the leg.

Games,False,"I'm  a Deadpool fan boy, I have a ton of Deadpool comics and merch. Don't get me wrong the Deadpool game from 2013 is fun and I think High Moon did a good job and tried their best and respect it, but I don't think it was all that true to the character, as he's more than just jokes and violence. His ragic backstory for one already tells us that. Something the game lacked, didn't have anything deep about it or any real stakes and the villains weren't really any villains Deadpool typically clasges with. If they ever make a new game I'd like to see the combat have more combos, and also less teleporting as Deadpool in the comics only used the teleporter briefly, it would be cooler if Deadpool just did flips and cartwheels and stuff like that, he's insanely agile and even though Deadpool likes to fight dirty and doesn't mind going for the cheapshots, he still likes  a bit of a challenge, its why he stopped using the teleportation belt in the comics. Another feature that'd be nice would be to actually be able to wear the different variations of his suit from the games, comics, and movies. I'd also like to see being able to fight with just his martial arts skills, maybe as for your first combat encounter and then quickly get the katanas, I'd like to see a new game really showcase his combat skills as despite being reckless he's a really skilled warrior.

 Being able  to see how he also abuses having a healing factor in combat would be cool, instead of just regenerative health, I think a mechanic where like if you lose a limb you can pick it up and beat up enemies with it or re-attach it, losing a limb could also change up his fighting style, like if he's fighting without both arms he starts to hold one of his katanas in his mouth and use his foot to hold the other one, it's ridiculous but I think it would be pretty fun, ive played a game with a similar mechanic called Splatterhouse which was a beat em up. As for weapons ofc he'd have his katanas, grenades guns, maybe to add some throwing stars/knives, his fists, and maybe the carbonadium blade he uses in Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe could be the last and also best weapon you can get in the game. Similar to the first game I'd bring back weapons you can pick up like those big ass guns you van pick up from heavy enemies but I'd go more in depth on that mechanic for example you'd be able to pick up and rip off turrets and mini guns, you could pick up chainsaws, rocket launchers, throwback explosives, baseball bats, etc. Characters I'd like to see show up in it would be Wolverine, Taskmaster, Domino, Bullseye, Hit Monkey, Barack the Leaper, Taskmaster, The Trapster Spider-Man, Copycat, Juggernaut, maybe the Flagsmashers/ Ultimatum, Omega Red, Hydra Bob, Weasel, Cable etc.

 There's a lot of characters they could have pop up in it and I think all those guys have interacted with Deadpool quite a few times or he's fought them before.  The plot could be something like Deadpool wanting revenge for what happened to him in the Weapon Plus program or it could be a similar to the Dead Presidents storyline, however I don't know how well Deadpool killing undead presidents would hold over, but something similar could make for an entertaining game and Deadpool was given quite a few deep moments in that arc. If I had to choose a writer to write for the game it'd have ti eb Gerry Duggan as he's my personal favorite writer for Deadpool comics.

TLDR: A new Deadpool game would be cool",Marvel,I'd like to see a new Deadpool game one day
Other,False,"Well as the title says I’m looking to get into the comic side of marvel, but being someone who has a reading disability it’s a little bit difficult.

I have two series in mind that I would like to take a look at I would just like to know where exactly to start

1. Civil War I would like to know the real story of what happens here

2. Infinity war I know this is more of an older story I don’t know if it’s been updated in recent years but I’d love to take a look at it

and then if anyone can just point me in the direction where to start with the characters I’m about to list,they don’t have to be long comic series about them just best places to find them. Maybe just a bit of their best well written stuff.

-taskmaster
-Black widow
-Iron Man
-Ultimate Spider-Man/Miles Morales
-Hawkeye
-Moonknight
-venom or carnage

Just looking for someone to point me in the best direction on where to start with the things I’ve listed I really appreciate it if someone can help",Marvel,What comics should I start with?

Film/Television,False,"I've been wanting to find a Marvel animated series to get into because I've never watched them. The past few days I have been watching Avengers Assemble. I'm at episode 22 of season 1 and I can't watch anymore. I really don't like it. There's many episodes where they do nothing but walk around arguing with each other over snacks or weird petty problems. So many filler episodes. The humor feels really childish. It's awkward to even watch it. If you like it, that's fine. This isn't an attack.. best you just ignore me.

I want a Marvel series that has lots of bad guys, fighting, character cameos, and just the good stuff like that. Less pizza, pickle, and candy jokes. Less sitting around the house arguing with each other.",Marvel,I'm not into Avengers Assemble. Can someone direct me to a show I'd like?
Film/Television,False,"I'm not the only one who got reminded of 1610 Norman Osborn when NWH Norman did his whole God speech, right?

Comics ,False,"I *really* want it to stick around after that story arc. Lizard is one of my favourite Marvel villains since I love reptiles but nowadays...he isn't exactly a villain anymore. The new Morbius/Lizard-Hybrid seems like a one-time villain of the evil corporation but what if he isn't? He might escape and try to survive out there, being out for human blood and a threat to Spiderman. The original Lizard is as smart as humans, so same could go for the vampire. He could be a supernatural assasin, some small but fun role ya know. What do you think?",Marvel,"(COMIC SPOILER ALERT) So, about the new Vampire Lizard..."
Film/Television,False,"Spider-Man is, in my opinion, the most popular superhero in Marvel and is on par with Batman as my favorite superhero. I believe that Marvel Studios did the one thing right about Spider-Man that makes him loved: not making him overused.

Spider-Man wasn't introduced in MCU until the 13th film, and even then, he's overshadowed by all the other superheroes since they've appeared more than him in film. I mean, Iron Man was the face of the MCU before Spider-Man came along, and even now he still is.

Even though Spider-Man has a lot of cartoons, the other superheroes were also given their fair share so that even if Spider-Man is the most popular hero, the other heroes in Marvel are still loved. Even the cartoon Earth's Mightiest Heroes doesn't introduce Spidey until WAAAY later on.

This, in my opinion, is what makes Spider-Man work right: even as the most popular character, he's not as overused as the rest.",Marvel,What Marvel did right with Spider-Man
Other,False,"There's joke comic called ""[the worst x-men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYE6e_wRhxI)"". It's main character is Bailey Hoskins...who's only power is to explode once before dying. He carries on having the worst luck: His parents randomly get stepped on by a sentinel. He gets sued for emotional damages by a villain. Then to cap it off: He's tricked into letting an assassin into Xavier's office and paved the way for the mutant takeover.

Since Bailey is kind of well known around the fandom - If they brought him back into another comic: People would go ""Ah, that's a fun cameo""

But then its slowly revealed its more then a cameo. In that same comic, there would be a mystery on the identity of a new villain. It turns out to be Bailey. In this universe, he's learnt to overcome his power' weakness. If a part of his body is cut off, he still can explode that loose piece. So by leaving stands of hair around, he can set off explodes without harming his main body.

After being rejected and laughed at for so many years, Bailey finally had enough.",Marvel,An ironic twist for the Worst Mutant
Comics ,False,I recently read through Spider-Man: Life Story and really enjoyed so decided to give FF: Life Story a go as well. I loved it but I noticed that issue five was released in December and judging by the previous release pattern it should be out by now. Has it been cancelled or is it not out yet? I should preface I’m reading on Marvel Unlimited.,Marvel,Issue six of Fantastic Four: Life Story.
Film/Television,False,"I was wondering what this sub thinks of the (majority animiated) marvel shows that are on disney+. I really want to get into marvel and love animation in general, but sometimes I get bored if something's too kid friendly. If they're worth watching tho I'd love to get a list of good shows especially for marvel newcomers!

Comics ,False,"Okay so I've not read much X-Men and I'm not a big fan of Captain Marvel but I know that Carol seems to keep turning up to fight Rogue for some reason all through her story, why?

I know Rogue gets her main power up from Carol but I'm not sure what caused the first fight, is this the cause of the bad blood all those years?

And I know in the most recent comics Rogue is on her way to help Carol as she's being held and forced to fight against her will",Marvel,Rogue Vs Captain Marvel - Why the hostility?

Comics ,False,"I hope It isn’t just me, but I feel Devil’s Reign is extremely weak. I usually love Zdarskys work, but just isn’t doing it for me. I absolutely love the art, but that seems to be the only thing I remember. It feels extremely messy and it feels like they are telling a story by mentioning all this other bullshit from other issues. It’s fair rare when I think a crossover even is good. Infinity Gauntlet and Civil War were great. Really great self contained stories, but Devil’s Reign, gah, just feels messy.",Marvel,Devil’s Reign

And how did he know where to find Wakanda where Vision with the mind stone was located ?
Comics ,False,"I read The Unbelievable Gwenpool and I love the run, but spoilers for that.

Anyway, I find that it has a really nihilistic perspective on the Marvel cosmology and I'm looking for some perspective.

Something that's obviously inherent to the comic run is that the Marvel multiverse is canonically not real. But it goes even farther than that. It's not even real to itself. No one remembers what happened before they were initially introduced unless they have a background they can remember. No one remembers what happens in between panels and scene changes. Random people that show up and you never see again literally don't exist anymore, canonically.

IMO part of the enjoyment of fiction is thinking that there's a whole fleshed out world or universe that exists beyond what you read about or see directly so having a comic tell me that not only is it fictional, but literally nothing happens outside of what you read even from the characters perspective, canonically, kind of sucks the enjoyment out of reading even other Marvel comics. I haven't gotten to Gwenpool Strikes Back yet, so maybe there's something in there that addresses it, but right now I'm just hoping someone give me some perspective or tells me I'm wrong.",Marvel,Marvel Cosmology Question
Film/Television,False,"Lets start with the obvious. Tom Cruise as Iron Man variant. Pushing away controversies and craziness, Tom Cruise is a legendary action mega star. This guy strapped himself to a plane that took off from the ground just for a scene. I would love to see this collab and Tom definitely bring his A-game for Tony Stark.   I also enjoyed Miles Teller take on Mr. Fantastic. He was one of the finer parts of the last Fantastic 4 movie.   What say ye?  Which actor/actress/hero pairing would you like to see appear in the MCMultiverse?",Marvel,Whats your favorite actoress/Avenger Variant?

Other,False,"Insanely long shot, I know, but I'm a content creator for Marvel Strike Force who tend to hide things in the background of their videos sometimes.

Comics ,False,"So It never occurred to me just how stomg of a Demonic being Dormammu is. 

Ive heard he's stronger than Celestials but others have said he's a tier below them and such. My assumption would be that he's equal to or slightly stronger than a Celestial right? Because he tules over the Dark Dimension which has its own rules and laws that I assume he had created.

Comics ,False,I haven’t read much featuring Black Panther but one thing I remember really liking the way he was characterized in Hickman’s New Avengers book. Is he normally like that in the comics? He’s not really like that in the movies so I didn’t know if it was just a different interpretation,Marvel,Is T’Challa usually kind of ruthless?
Comics ,False,"Recently Punisher went through the very contraversial change of replacing his guns with swords and getting a weird new logo. I don't think was a very wise decision and hope they return him to his traditional self eventually, but that's a discussion for another time. But imagine if Marvel did replaced Thor's hammer with an uru spoon?

For this to work, Thor gets his hammer lost/destroyed and he naturally is really sad. At the Celestial Avengers headquarters in the arctic, he eats a bowl of cereal next to Jennifer Walters, and then he looks at his spoon. He sees his shining reflection on the spoon and makes a devilish grin. ""SPOOOOON!!!!"" he shouts! Jennifer gets confused, but Thor says that he has an idea.

Later he goes to Asguard, and then he finds a spoon made of uru. He uses his power of lighting and thunder to charge it up, and a bolt of lighting bursts from the spoon! Although anyone could weild this spoon unlike Thor's hammer, he could still shoot powerful lighting, and show his foes who's the alpha male by slapping his opponents with a spoon. How would u feel if this became an actual story in the comics on the near future? Would u be disappointed? Or would that be the greatest achievement in comicbook history?",Marvel,What If Thor's Hammer Was Replaced By An Uru Spoon?

Film/Television,False,"I totally loved this movie when I saw it in theater. Could not help but several times think ""this is already significantly better than the first"".

This story is pretty neat. Nothing that is full of layers, it's a simple love story about Cletus wanting to reunite and marry Shriek, and Eddie has his own problems with Venom

Eddie does great as Eddie and Venom. Harrelson.....is not ideally cast as Cletus but he tolerable. Carnage is fucking badass. I was hoping his voice would sound like something close to the PS1 Spider-Man game's Carnage, but this voice we got is still pretty awesome and sounds kinda gangsta like, and the roar is just beautiful 

Shriek, she's fucking awesome in this and Noami Harris is such great casting. I'd like to see more of her. MoM could bring her back to life, maybe?

I also think the action scenes are a significant improvement on the first. For one....I can actually see what's happening and there isn't a CGI sludge like the first movie

At first, I had a problem with the fact that Carnage dies in this movie, looking like that's just it for him, but Serkis says he isn't really dead...I'll take his word for it. I bet he will be warped to the MCU or something before his death takes place",Marvel,Does anyone here actually like Venom: Let There Be Carnage?

Now that seems cool, but where do I start for getting context that isn’t the 60s? Because I was kinda expecting like, the school and all that usual stuff. But not to hate this seems really cool, just idk wtf half of them are talking about.

Comics ,False,"What I like about the ultimate universe is that you can follow a line and read along it.

Comics ,False,"I dont see why he wouldn't able to for a few reasons.

3: Honor, Purity and the willingness to break and destroy. The punishers entire case for being is to rid the world of criminals, monsters and degenerates by any means necessary.

And it had me thinking, would it be possible For Reed Richards to either remove the rocky exterior of Ben and replace with some kind of artificial, super skin. Or heck, put a layer of artificial skin over the rock. In either case, Reed can give some kind of cosmetic transplant to give more ""normal"" facial features, or I guess some kind of image inducer to help with the rest. He could also just use an image inducer but I imagine Ben would enjoy having that skin for the sake of any romantic partners and just feeling more normal, both figuratively and literally as the skin could have some kind of synaptic capability to make Ben feel through it. Probably wouldnt be that hard, I think the sense of touch is one of the more easier things we can figure out in the brain. 

What do you all think? Seems like a pretty plausible route the comics can take thats a more middle of the road approach to Ben becoming human again. Can even be a pretty long term thing since a lot of problems can still happen.

""I think the world-building problem with mutants is that there is actually no way to know who is a mutant and who is a mutate, and this only ever addressed in X-Men stories.

We the audience know that Spiderman was bite by a radioactive spider, but he doesn't go around advertising the fact. This is a plot point in House of M where Peter is basically indistinguishable from a mutant unless you know his personal history, something he keeps under wraps.

Mutants as a concept work fine by themselves, but always seem to press against the borders of the wider universe where they never quote perfectly fit.

The logical problem with mutants isn't the in-universe logic, but the out of universe logic of how do they know who is a mutant in the first place? Did they read the script?""

""we as readers know the real reason for the distinction between mutants and mutates (and the fact that only the former face any sort of serious prejudice) is that X-Men stories and eg. Fantastic Four stories are separate, with separate themes. So ""oh you know bigotry is irrational heh and it just happens to break down irrationally in this highly convenient way heh"" isn't very convincing.

In the real world, sure, bigotry is irrational, but it's not irrational in convenient / *nice* ways. Real-world bigotry lumps Sikhs in with Arabs, say. Or - try walking around in the Jim Crow south hand-in-hand with a white lady while you have black skin, explaining to people that ""oh no I'm not *technically* of African descent"" - you would literally get lynched before you could even begin to explain.

Marvel's bigots caring about the distinction between mutants and mutates isn't them being irrational - just the opposite. It's them being bizarrely, extremely precise and careful in a way that real-world bigots almost never are.""

""Let me put it this way: if Catra shows up in Remnant, would the residents know that she's not actually a cat Faunus? No. She would face the same discrimination as any Faunus would.

But the people in the Marvel Universe not only are able to magically tell who is a mutant and who is a ""mutate"", they even know which mutants they are ""supposed"" to discriminate against (as far as I know, Shriek, Whirlwind, Typhoid Mary, Razorback and Molly Hayes never faced discrimination for being mutants).""

Also: even though she was retconned into not being a mutant anymore, Squirrel Girl never faced any ""anti-mutant"" discrimination back when she was written as a mutant.

Film/Television,False,"     So the movie would start right after No way home where Venom and Eddie would be roughly in New York (no explanation just go with it) and they would see stories from the daily bugle on some newspapers titled ""Beware the Spider-Menace."" 

     Venom and Eddie talk discuss Spider-Man and Venom talks about how in other universes that Spidey is a problem and must be dealt with. Eddie says ""Alright let's go find this web head."" 

     Andrew Garfield would return from the mcu into his universe with his arm up on nothing and sit on the edge of a building to think about the events of no way home. There would be a quick flash to Gwen's death, him saving MJ, and Tobey calling him amazing, before putting on his mask and swinging away. (With added TASM 2 theme and title, which i do not know. Please give ideas in the comments)

     Cut to Peter at his own house. He lives in a small house in the suburbs (idk where i don't live in new york). Venom and Eddie are in a coffee shop reading the paper, reading about Spidey's ""crimes"" when they see Spider-Man swinging by out a window and run out the door immediately.

      They see Spider-Man swing away and go into a nearby alleyway to transform and they chase after him. Venom takes some notes from Spidey and starts to swing like him using his tentacles (but with more property damage). Spider-Man eventually lands near a bank robbery and comes in to stop it when Venom grabs the robbers with a tentacle and is about to eat them, and eats one robbers head, when Spidey rips them from his grasp and tells Venom that ""criminals belong in jail, not your stomach"" (10 out of 10 joke, I know) when Venom grabs Spider-Man and smashes him into the ground. Spider-Man seems to be too injured to fight back and Venom walks and picks him up by his neck. Only for Spidey to kick him in the face and knock him back a bit. The fight is pretty evenly matched but slowly starts to be in Spider-Man's favor. 

       The fight is interrupted by a loud crashing sound and a crowd of scared new yorkers running, followed by a Yellow symbiote with big hair roaring at the crowd.


(To be continued when I think of more stuff.)",Marvel,My idea for an Amazing Spider-Man vs Venom movie.
Film/Television,False,"I know recently got What if and that there have been animated tv series and a few movies but not a lot lately. DC generally is known for making better animated movies but I wanna see Marvel make a few, separate from MCU.",Marvel,Anyone else wanna see more Marvel animated movies and series?
Film/Television,False,"I'm kinda bummed out that we are not gonna see Eddie/Venom in the MCU.... Yeah sure we got that major dicktease in the Let There Be Carnage post-credit scene where Eddie is warped into the MCU and of course Eddie in the mid credits, is warped back into the Sony universe, but a little bit of Venom is left behind.

I really wish Sony didn't punk us like that. I would love to see Eddie and the right version of Venom interact with the MCU characters, especially Peter too obviously.

Eddie is completely different from the comics, it's a version that is a lot more likeable and is totally his own character, but I would have loved to see ""them"" interact with all other MCU characters, just something about the kind of character Hardy's Eddie/Venom is playing around in the MCU, and I guess we will never get that..",Marvel,Eddie in NWH...
Film/Television,False,"so obidiah staine wants to build an iron man suit like tonys. Assuming thats so he can make profit making a lot of them, right? ok, but then later on, he paralyzes tony then walks away. Then when tony comes back.. he gets in his suit to fight him? why didnt he just kill him earlier? Seems like he only built the suit to fight all the guys at the end. which wouldnt have happened if he didnt try to build the suit in the first place....",Marvel,can someone explain the plot of iron man 1?
Film/Television,False,"So, I’m curious as to what the proper order is to watch the entirety of the MCUMV, including the original 3 spider man movies, both of the amazing spider-man movies, both of the venom movies (since he had a cameo in the new spider-man i think his character/movies become technically canon to the MV), Morbius (since i believe this takes place in venoms universe?), all of the associated X-men, Logan, First Class etc., Deadpool, and THEN, FINALLY, the MCU proper and it’s associated TV shows like Jessica Jones, The Punisher, Luke Cage, Daredevil, Iron Fist, The Defenders, and Agents of Shield. 

Now I know that when it gets to the TV shows some seasons are in between certain movies and some are between others, specifically agents of shield i believe this happens multiple times (haven’t had the time to sit and watch that series). 

But does anyone have a movie-by-movie/season-by-season full sequence of the MCUMV mapped out?",Marvel,What is the true movie sequence to watch the entire multiverse in correct order?
Other,False,"I'll admit I am more of a casual reader so I thought I would ""seek a higher power"" on here (you'll see the irony soon). So I was reading up on how magic works in Marvel and for the most part it makes sense. A person channels energy from different sources in order to bend and reshape reality in specific ways, often with the help of symbols, incantations and items. But then I was thinking about all the different sources of magic and I have a few questions:

1. Can all magic be traced back to a single source since it's all energy? For example, Dr Strange channels power from the Vishanti. But where do the Vishanti get their power from? Do they generate infinite amounts of this energy on their own or do they also channel it from somewhere else? Same goes for dimensions. Are dimensions that magic is channelled from fuelled by something higher up on the food chain or is each dimension an infinite generator of energy? Could it all be traced back to something like the Power Stone, the Living Tribunal, the Phoenix Force, the Life Force or the One Above All?
2. What makes different sources of magic...different? Is it all the same energy but just at different levels of potency? For example, why can Chaos magic rewrite the laws of reality but other magic can't? I know skill and knowledge is a factor but it seems like Chaos magic is so legendary because it can do things that other types of magic are simply incapable of doing.
3. If magic is the manipulation of energy to create a desired effect, why aren't superheroes like Susan Storm and Captain Marvel considered magic users since their powers involve manipulating energy (even though their abilities would be considered simple compared to the things magic users can do)?",Marvel,Where does Magic come from exactly?
Comics ,False,"I'm a huge fan of the Matt Fraction and Duane Swierczynski Iron Fist run but other than that I haven't really read much. But I have just finished watching the Netflix series which I avoided for 5 years because everyone told me how much it sucked. And I absolutely loved it! Yeah it makes a lot of changes but I kinda don't care. I loved the cast and characters, Ward Meachum and Colleen Wing being major standouts for me.

And I was just wondering if anyone had any Collen Wing comics recommendations? I can see she mainly features with Misty in Daughters of the Dragon stories. I've picked up the recent Jed McKay mini series but nobody has really made a comprehensive list of their best stories.",Marvel,Colleen Wing and Misty Knight - the Daughters of the Dragon

Comics ,False,"Just started reading on marble unlimited, never read before. I tried reading some “recommended.” Series of x-men because the characters interest me. But idk what’s going on 😂. 

Like I’ve only seen the movies, I was kinda expecting like, the mansion school and all that. Instead it’s Prof x and magneto being besties arguing international relations about their weird new island utopia lol. Also evil pensioners. 

Now it seems cool just, where’s a good starting point for context that isn’t the 60s? I want something relatively modern and simple for a starting point.",Marvel,How do I get into X-men?
Other,False," I loved Marvel stories. Even before I actually got hooked to MCU, I loved the comics themselves. The various storylines and character arcs made them feel real and close. Some stories were just &amp;\^$%$, but others were gold. The sliding timescale thing always bugged me, but I ignored it in favor of good stories.

But this is too much! This makes no sense to me at all. Characters keep dying and reviving. Status Quo changes according to the authors' and editors' whims. Previous character arcs just go down the authors' toilet. No character ever progresses from where they were 20 or 50 years ago. Some author comes and makes a fantastic story about the character. Then another one comes and builds upon that. And then another one comes up and does god knows what and ruins it. And all this happens in the span of 10 days in-universe. And if you think my description of the passage of in-universe time is inaccurate, I am sorry. However, that is how it exactly feels to me.

Spiderman is still a Young-Adult-like persona that is struggling. He did not move forward an inch. Yes, his character arc has progressed in individual authors' stories. But he is still there for the last 50 years fighting the same villains and meanwhile his friends are supposedly married and have 13-year-old kids. So what does that make spiderman's age? According to the authors, less than 30 for sure.

It feels like these are not stories of individual characters and people, rather cooked dreams of an author. So that as a new author pulls up the character, he dreams of another one. The latest case seems to be the X-men line and the Avengers line. God! After so long, there was some progression in the X-men line. Thankfully they kept the Krakoa part, but they are killing Moira and bringing her back as an Android. Great! Avengers used to have a weight to them. Now it feels like authors are struggling to find new villains and villain groups for them to get beat up by and then conquer. And I am sure they will make it so the in-universe time will still be 1 year.

Consistency goes down the flush. Character uniformity and arcs go down the flush. Respect for a character's past history goes down the flush. Phoenix is supposedly Thor's mother and not — all at the same time. Stories are happening in the same universe but feel so damn disjointed. And I know the technical and editorial reasons behind that. I just hate that. No coordination between authors working in the same in-universe stories. No respect for each other's stories either.

Why can't we finally have captain America retire and age? Cause he is a super soldier, I get it. However, the reason he was young was that he was frozen in time. Now he isn't. So why can't he age like normal even after 20 or 30 years? The same for other heroes. What about Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkey, Spiderman, Black Panther, Star-Lord, Charles Xavier, Punisher, Doctor Strange, Dr. Doom, Mr. Fantastic, and all the others? What about their super kids or teenage superheroes that were introduced 10 years ago to 20 years ago? How long are they going to stay Superkids and teenage superheroes? Will their stories move forward in time or just stay stuck like that? Stuffing 10 years' worth of in-universe stories in 1 year of in-universe time.

I understand that people love those superheroes and that is why they are willing to pay money to read their stories. However, people also love Macbeth and Harry Potter. Not like the sales of those books dropped. Why can't marvel give superheroes their own lives and stories? And let them experience the passage of time. That will help the readers connect with them more. And then maybe they will have options to bring new ideas and new superheroes for a new age. Not just keep stuffing new superheroes as teen superheroes and then keep the supposedly 70-year-old character still going young along with them!

Anyway, this was my rant/vent. I am done with Marvel. I had no hopes with DC, to begin with. I guess novels and mangas are the only sources of good stories left. Good stories that don't suddenly get thrown in the trashcan by another author mishandling the same characters for his own fetishes/kinks.",Marvel,I am done with Marvel! WTH Marvel???

She’s distraught how far they have fallen and seeks to rebuild it…. At any cost. She 1 v 2s Thor and Loki in the first act and then takes power over the entire kingdom. I liked her fight with the loyal general and his men. She’s overpowered but not like….. comedicly overpowered. It’s just explained she’s a really good fighter from an era when Asgard was nothing but fighters. It took a planet killing demon to destroy her and I’m not even sure that was enough. Also I just thought the line “you can’t defeat me” with Thor saying “I know but he can” was just super bad ass. All around great movie. Wish we got more Hela in other marvel works.,Marvel,Anyone else think Hela (Thor Ragnorak) is kinda underrated. What’s the broader communities opinion on her as a character and a villain?

ACCURATE the venitians are so used to water

""bho"" mj says it can be get out of my face, not true it mean ""I don't know"" and all other general I don't know meaning.

even with the first movie Spiderman is sooo strong wow

italian mayor would have whooped misterio ass for all that cultural damage
aunt May is HOT

so mj say l'uomo del mistero means ""the man of mistery"" while it could be accepted kinda 
that's not really what the news says it could be more accurately translated as ""the man of this mistery (this strange phenomenon)......."" 
the man of mistery/the mistery man"" would be ""l'uomo misterioso""

do American school have this much money to go on different countries trip? the only place I've been to was the coliseum and it's 20 minutes subway from my school.
also i think Misteriois the one summoning this creatures to stage the fights

Marvel Wiki claims Latveria is considered one of the world's superpowers solely based on Doom's advanced techs, but how does it compare militarily with Wakanda, Atlantis, and Marvel's version of US, EU and China?

But if Latveria is so powerful, why is it still so tiny as a landlocked country and why hasn't it taken over its much weaker European neighbors such as Romania, Hungary, former Sokovia, and even parts of Western Russia?

Logically as an immensely proud Latverian, wouldn't Doom wants his beloved nation to be huge  and intimidating instead of being a puny landlocked dot on the world map?

Personally, I say the comics version of Phil Coulson. I've only been passively following the current Avengers run (I'm not actively collecting it, but I try to keep up with what's happening as it goes), but making Phil Coulson a satanist who sells his soul to worships Mephisto, intentionally Flashpoints the Marvel Universe, and is now trapped in Hell for what seems like an eternity is a big one. Might just be the AOS bias talking, but I prefer him being the heart and soul of the Marvel Universe. I have no idea why Jason Aaron would do that, and I've vowed I'd find a way to undo it if I ever get to write for Marvel someday.

Former scientist Hank left the Avengers after seeing attempts to master the technique of shortening his anatomy. Hank thinks the technology could be dangerous if cloned, so he promises to hide it for the rest of his life. Today, Hank's naughty daughter and her former partner Darren forced her out of a company called Hank Technologies. Darren wears a miniature costume called his ""Yellow Jacket"", which scares Hank.

Hank, who tricked Scott into not stealing the case as evidence from the unconscious Lewis, wants Scott to be the new acid who stole Darren's yellow coat. Hope is outraged by the death of Janet, Pam's mother. It turns out that Janet, known as the bee, disappeared into the quantum world when she dropped an atomic bomb. Pim warned Scott that he would protect the same race if he destroyed the process. He was sent by Avengers Headquarters to steal the device. The Avengers find Scott, kill him, put on his suit, and render him useless.

Darren finished his yellow jacket dress. Scott enters the building with a swarm of seeds flying with the crew and detonates the explosives. Scott and his friends were arrested. Scott is freed and fights him and Hope's agents. When Darren was mad at Hank, he was suddenly fired. With a blast of explosives, Scott fights Darren, which blows up the entire building, causing Darren great anxiety.

Darren was wearing a ""yellow jacket"" and attacked Scott before arresting his girlfriend. Darren enters Scott's house and takes Casey back. Scott straightens up to the point where he rubs the suit, allowing Darren to enter the suit and lose control. Scott disappears into the Quantum World, but changes and returns alone. Paxton respects Scott's actions and releases Scott from prison. When Hank sees Scott alive and returns from the Quantum World, he asks if his wife is alive.",Marvel,I put Ant-Man into google translate. Here is what it came up with:

But with the multiverse blowing up and the setup of Kang the Conqueror as the next big villain, another villain should be introduced and built up before-hand. ANNIHILUS AND THE ANNIHILATION WAVE. Here are the many reasons why. 

Annihilus is probably my one of my favorite antagonists in the Marvel Universe. But also, one of the most deadly. And it can be a great threat to introduce for the Marvel Cosmic Universe. Here’s how everything can be setup in the Annihilation movie and it boils down to very important characters. 

- NOVA (Richard Rider):
This is no doubt the most important character to include in this Star Wars type epic. As well as one of the most prominent and captivating heroes to graze the cosmos, transforming into a force to be reckoned with after the entire Nova Corps gets wiped out and puts him on an emotional journey to become his own character and fight the good fight. 

- ADAM WARLOCK:
Now, with the introduction of Adam Warlock in ‘Guardians 3’, his story may be different than his counterpart due to the absence of Thanos and the Infinity Stones. However, that doesn’t mean he can’t work in the MCU at all because I believe he can. He is without a doubt such a great character to explore in different ways and fitting him into the world of the Guardians of the Galaxy is a great way to begin and to add him to the Annihilation crossover down the line. 

- THE FANTASTIC FOUR:
Marvel’s First Family. One of the most famous characters in literature will definitely be a perfect fit for this storyline. Not only will it be fun to see Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch and The Thing in the MCU again, but they have connections to the main villain himself; Annihilus as well as the Negative Zone. They also fit the vibe of cosmic craziness and off-world adventures as well as fill the void of dysfunctional family when the Guardians part ways. 

- QUASAR (Wendell Vaughn)
Another Earth-bound hero with a huge presence across the galaxy, the defender of the Quantum Bands will fit in nicely to the Annihilation story. As a possibility to pair up Vaughn with characters like Nova and Star-Lord. Also, he fits in with the story of the MCU as more of the films start to reach across the cosmos. 

The movies that can tell this story could be the following:
- Captain Marvel 2
- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
- Fantastic Four
- Nova (Movie or D+ series)
- Secret Invasion (D+ series)
- ANNIHILATION",Marvel,Annihilation Should be the Next NCU Saga for Phase 5

Film/Television,False,"Spoilers for SHIELD, of course.

Ward got absolutely screwed by everyone on that show. He was abused as a child, taken in by a psychopath, effectively brainwashed (even if it wasn't special swirly pictures brainwashing), and yeah he betrayed them but in a given season they all commit treason at least once per person if not collectively.

When Ward gets caught he feels bad. He asks for forgiveness, he does what he can with the tools he has to seek it. At every single turn they reject it. When Daisy gets brainwashed by Hive does anyone hold that against her? Even after she has Hive removed, and betrays everyone, they all beg her to come back.

Then we find out that Ward actually is a good person! Gasp! In the Framework it turns out that, shockingly, had Ward not been abused and brainwashed, he would have been a good person. They still treat \*the fake Ward, who is good\* like a piece of shit because he looks like a guy they knew, of course.

For Ward to not even show up in the last season feels like the greatest missed opportunity, and apparently they never even asked the actor if he was interested. At least a cameo where they take him away from Garret or something? Personally, I think it should have been what the whole season was about, like the Chronicoms need to mess up the timeline and Ward being saved is the critical piece in the timeline.

Also, it's hard to watch the show and not sort of see SHIELD as the villains. They are absolutely a rogue terrorist organization with advanced military weapons who are willing and able to basically destroy the universe for personal gain. I mean they very plainly do this on multiple occasions. But that's a separate issue.

Film/Television,False,"First of all, I would like to point out that if someone has said this before, I am sorry. I haven't checked.

Secret Wars (2015) was a massive event. In my opinion, it may be the biggest event of them all. I think the MCU may be leading up to this. But first, we need to talk about the Sony Pictures Universe of Marvel Characters (SPUMC).

When Sony released Venom, they announced that it would be part of its own shared universe. This is the SPUMC. As of now, it only consists of Venom and Venom: Let there be Carnage, as well as soon to be Morbius. There are a whole bunch of other things in planned / announced: Kraven the Hunter film, Madame Web film, Jackpot film, Silk TV series, etc. I highly doubt that most of it will actually be made, but you never know.

In the Secret Wars event, the 616 universe and the Ultimate universe collided. I think that by 2026 or whenever Marvel Studios is ready to do Secret Wars, they may be able to strike a deal with Sony and do an MCU version of Secret Wars with the MCU colliding with the SPUMC.

You may be able to say, ""But if they want it to be huge, why not use the X-Men or Defenders universes for Secret Wars""? The actors from the X-Men are too old, and the Defenders characters are starting to make their (somewhat different) appearances throughout the MCU.

Film/Television,False,"I think the film does a fantastic job of filling in the viewer on details. 

So if you haven't watched Daredevil, you don't know how Matt caught that brick, but neither does Peter. 

If you haven't watched the Raimi films, you might miss out some jokes but really no crucial information is lost and the film fills you in. 

If you haven't watched the Webb films you do need to infer that (Andre Garfield's) Peter is crying after saving Michelle because he couldn't save Gwen (which you're told happened so you can connect the dots but it isn't spelled out for you). But again, other than that the film fills you in.

The great thing in the handling of these other franchise in my opinion is that really if you don't already know these details you're never behind (Tom Holand') Peter Parker. 

In comparison if you don't know Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock (which I have to assume there's a non-zero percentage of viewers in that camp), you really don't have any context to who or what Venom is. 

So yeah as much as you get more added value from watching the 5 previous Spider-Man films and the Daredevil show, they are optional while I think the Venom film is mandatory to get that scene.

Film/Television,False,"**Spoilers! from NWH feel free to get spoiled or watch it first. Alright if you're still here then you've been warned.**

Now that Aaron Davis finally makes his appearance in Homecoming how do you think his nephew might make his first appearance? The thing here is Aaron already became the Prowler in Homecoming except he's not wearing the suit. What about his nephew Miles? I know it would be difficult to introduce Miles since Peter is still on the way through college years and possibly trying to help MJ and Ned to remember him, but just because Miles is going to appear doesn't mean I want him to become Spider-Man already and Peter to ""Die"" (which I hope it won't happen). I can already imagine in the MCU that Miles is a kid from Brooklyn and a huge fan of Spider-Man but he doesn't know who is in the mask. Now the other question here is how do you think Miles and Pete might cross paths and meet up in the MCU but NOT as Spider-Man or in their costumes yet. I can already imagine that Miles is going to end up as a friend of Pete and later will find out that he is Spider-Man and he will also help him through Spider-Man-related activities similar to Insomniac. Now let's talk about their age gap, I can already imagine that Pete is going to be 5 years older than Miles, but there's also a possibility that Miles might share the same age as Peter because of the Blip. Now let's talk about how he will be involved in the MCU as a side character and later an ally on Peter's crusade.

Here's my take on how Miles will appear. There will be a scene where a young Miles is taking a picture/video of Spider-Man fighting armed men and then Spider-Man saves him. The kid is shocked when he was saved/met by Spider-Man in person. Peter might end up working at FEAST in a short time to help some of its people there in the memory of his late aunt, but imagine if he ends up meeting one of the workers there named Rio Morales and Peter might end up meeting her son, Miles Morales. The two became close like brothers and somehow share the same struggle in school life and both are science nerds. Sometimes Peter even ends up helping him with his school projects and Miles tells Peter a story on how he was saved by Spider-Man and how it changed his life. Imagine if Peter also ends up meeting a cop who is Miles' father and Aaron's estranged brother, Jefferson Davis, and sadly he's not a fan of Spider-Man. Miles might appear in either from the **4th** film's post-credit scene where he saw Spider-Man web-swinging in the sky for the first time. **5th** film as a kid who loves Spider-Man and takes a video/picture of him in one of the scenes and Peter finally meets Miles along with his family for the first time and ends up as one of Peter's social friends along with MJ and Ned or just in case Gwen, Harry, Flash or any other friends that Peter had. While in the **6th** film Miles finally finds out Peter Parker is Spider-Man and this film might show some foreshadowing that Miles will become a hero of his own one day. Then maybe in the 6th film's post-credit scene, one of the radioactive spiders from the laboratory found its way to escape (whether from Oscorp, Roxxon, or even Alchemax) and might make it into Miles' backpack/jacket to bit him later.

Now, this is my take on how Miles might become Spider-Man of his own. Miles might have a movie/series of his own with Prowler as the possible main villain or Roxxon Corporation similar to comics and game. Miles might also need help in his powers with Peter as a mentor similar of how Peter was like Tony Stark to Miles MCU Peter. They might even team up through universal threats like Kang or any other heavy hitters when the universe is at stake. All of this is just my speculation so I hope you guys like it and feel free to express your opinions on how Miles might make it into the MCU.",Marvel,My take on how Miles might appear in the MCU.

Film/Television,False,"i'm a little confused on the timelines that the villains and other spideys were brought from.

all of the villains appear to be taken from their universes where they were just about to die. Electro recognized this, and Doc Ock recognized this.

(i'm going to break it down via universes so it hopefully makes some sense)

Tobey's Universe
so while they're in the dungeon, both Otto and Norman recognize each other. Otto informs Norman that he was killed. however, if Norman had not died, Otto would not have been transformed into Doc Ock. In SM2, it was Harry Osborn who took over Oscorp after Norman died, and Harry was the one who sponsored the fusion project that inevitably created Doc Ock. therefore, the Norman and Otto we see in NWH must be from different universes (or different timelines). additionally, Sandman helps Holland during the battle with Electro, presumably because of the events that happened in SM3. again, different universes/timelines.

so does this mean that all the characters we see are in fact all from different universes? or are we seeing the characters pulled from different points in time? 

Andrew's Universe
there isn't much overlap between The Lizard and Electro, however Garfield mentions that he's cured Connors once, and he can do it again. but in NWH we see The Lizard pre-cure. this again must mean that Garfield, Connors, and Dillon are all from different timelines, or at minimum different universes.

i guess what confuses me is how they are pulled from each and how they all recognize their respective villains/spider-men from each universe. how could Dr. Strange's spell go back in time and pull everyone from different time periods?

additionally, back to my point with Norman and Doc Ock (and sticking to the timeline approach) if Norman goes back to his universe without the Green Goblin, he doesn't die, Harry doesn't take over Oscorp, and Doc Ock isn't created. so where does Doc Ock go back to? has Strange created a plethora of branches on each timeline?

thanks for listening. i think this conundrum is what is going to be the premise of MoM–the fact that Strange has now created so many branches and altered reality for each.

interested to hear what your guys' thoughts are",Marvel,question about NWH (SPOILERS!!)
Film/Television,False,"For context, I dont follow her comics very much, but I've read a couple storylines. Kamala's powers being changed is something I had an issue with at first. I thought that they were making a huge mistake, which they still could be. But kamala's powers would look terrible in cgi, because when she uses her powers she often shows skin, so you would get an uncanny valley feel of it. I do thing it would have been better to just Chang her costume a little, but they obviously won't do that. This could also be a good sign for the future of marvel in general, as the power change is a risk that could alienate some comic fans. This shows that they are ready and willing to take some pretty big risks, but that cod lead to some pretty good rewards. From the trailer Kamala seems to have the personality of her comic book counterpart, and I love that. The only thing I feel is a bad thing, is not making her an inhuman, but who knows, maybe she will be at the end, I think it would be a good twist for a possible season 2.",Marvel,Ms. Marvel's power change can be a good thing
Film/Television,False,"First of all, i want to tell everyonme that i am not posting this out of malice, i'm posting this out of genuine love to Kamala Khan and her world.

I feel the MCU has become so loved that whenever we have legitimate criticism of it, it's immediately dismissed because of what the MCU has done, but just because it generally has done good movies, it doesn't mean we shouldn't critisize the bad, specially with a character as important as Ms Marvel.

We can dislike what the MCU is seemingly about to do with a character, and it's ok to not accept the excuses people make up.

* ""It's to differentiate her from Mr Fantastic"". Well there's no problem with differentiating them in the comics
* ""It's to bring her closer to Carol's powers"". That's worse, she's called Ms Marvel, but she's not supposed to be Carol's analogue or sidekick, their relationship is not like that.
* ""The CGI would look weird"". That's the point of her powers, she's supposed to look weird when using them, making them pretty glowing stuff is not the answer. Rita Farr in Doom Patrol shows what can be done.
* ""The Inhumans show was awful"". So bring in new Inhumans, they brought so many characters, specially previously criticized characters, back recently.

MCU fandom excuses everything, we can't be real fans if we don't react to what we dislike.",Marvel,It's entirely ok to dislike the apparent changes to Kamala's powers and world in Ms Marvel
Comics ,False,"I’ve read a lot of spidey/avengers stuff, but after playing the gotg game and rewatching the x men movies. I’m looking for some recommendations if anyone knows some good stories",Marvel,Anyone know any good gotg/X-men comics to check out?
Other,False,"The backlash that Kamalas powers aren't the same in the mcu show is so stupid. The MCU is its own universe and as we have seen via Spiderman they can change ANYTHING they want. You wouldn't say penny parker isn't a spider person cause her power are different and the same should go with the MCU it is its own unique distinct universe and owes us nothing they could change what ever they like, when ever they like, as much as they like, and it's still valid because it's not 616 or any other universe. This backlash makes me wish they did isolated mini event 'kamala-verse' as I'm calling it. With each version having a different power or representation of that power to show that each universe is different.",Marvel,I really hope they do a kamala-verse just to piss off idiots.
Comics ,False,"Now that Comixology has been ruined, I'm looking for a new place to get my digital comics. How do you guys like the digital comics from Marvel.com? I'd rather buy individual books rather than get a monthly subscription.

I'm noticing that some digital issues aren't available on Marvel.com even though they've been available on Comixology for quite some time. Is this kind of delay normal?",Marvel,What are your experiences with buying digital comics from Marvel.com?

Just my opinion",Marvel,Thoughts on Ms Marvel
Film/Television,False,"It's easily in the top five best MCU films for me. It's nostalgic in the best ways possible, it's super badass, having the first two generation Spider-Men be in this film...that will always be  a huge standout in the MCU, straight up.

I'm writing this, because I just got it on digital, it's the first time since theaters that I've seen it. 

Doc Ock, Green Goblin, and Electro are all friggin great in this. Sandman and Lizard are just ok....they both seem to just...be there. The other three standout for me.

I so hope this film gets another follow up with Holland as full blown classic Spider-Man",Marvel,No Way Home is badass!
Film/Television,False,"Ok so all of the Netflix Marvel shows are on Disney+, Daredevil, Punisher, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist. What I care about the most are Daredevil and Punisher

Film/Television,False,"Andy Serkis said that Carnage is not dead. That is totally a good thing, because that one little movie is just not enough when it comes to utilization. I thought that movie was pretty good and Carnage was badass af in, but I also know there is so much more that can be done with him.

This movie must have been some kind of trial for Carnage to see ppl's feedback. If he is not dead, that must mean that Carnage will be warped into the MCU or something moments before his death.

But for the love of god....do not give Carnage another host..needs to be Cletus, and he should get a different cast. 

It's phenomenal how NWH made it so easy to bring back past characters from other universes. Hell, if they wanted to, they could bring back Jackman's Wolverine from the events of The Wolverine before his healing was suppressed and de-age Jackman in post 🤷🏻‍♂️

Film/Television,False,"With the new trailer of ms.marvel unsurprisingly before thor love and thunder looks like Disney is going with teenagers audience this time with WandaVision for grownups and Hawkeye as a family show but the trailer doesn't show much of antagonist side of ms.marvel with this also being 6 episode series half of the episodes are sure to be linked with kamala's teenage problems mixed with supehero stuff

So definitely ms marvel is going to teamup with Captain Marvel and Monica Rambo in The Marvels and with MCU setting up Secret Invasion as shown in far from home and wanda vision kree are expected to be antagonist here but will they? As secret invasion was done by skrulls and MCU only has shows them as good guys under poor conditions

In comics ms.marvel powers were from inhuman mist but MCU is not using that and we don't see inhuman series or movie anywhere here so disney is changing kamala khan origin powers

Kamala said she ‘feels cosmic’ in the trailer but her initial understanding of her powers is likely flawed plus she is a Captain Marvel super fan. Plus the whole bracelets being important to Djinn powers is straight out of Islamic folklore. I would not be surprised in the slightest if Kamala can indeed shapeshift into other people and she shapeshifts into Carol Danvers when she first attains her powers just like in the comics. Mind you, G. Willow Wilson, the co-creator of Ms. Marvel is working on this.",Marvel,About Ms. Marvel’s reimagined powers/origin…

Film/Television,False,"If The Avengers existed in the real world, then Tony would be 100% right, but within the world of the MCU his stance completely overlooks the most influential political event in recent history.

Tony wants The Avengers to be under the control of The UN because they are too powerful to be left unchecked and they need governmental oversight. The problem with this is that The Avengers literally started as a international defense organization, and the people running it turned out be be a bunch of actual nazis.

The UN and SHIELD were both formed immediately after the end of WW2. The UN is a political organization, meaning it would be much easier to infiltrate than SHIELD, and HYDRA still had funding coming from SOMEWHERE after the fall of SHIELD.

*Also side note, if I was in the MCU and I just found out Nazis had been controlling SHIELD for 70 years (which is a primarily US-based organization) I would find it extremely suspicious that the UN’s rules don’t allow them to punish the United States for committing genocide. It seems like exactly the kind of rule HYDRA would make if they were pulling the strings.*

It is frankly ridiculous that nobody even floats the idea that the UN might be compromised and half of them just go “Golly gee, I guess we should let them tell us what to do! The UN are the good guys after all!”",Marvel,Tony is blatantly wrong in Civil War and I can’t get over it.

The producer also clarified the other rumors claiming that Professor X’s return is part of the MCU’s introduction of the cabal the Illuminati, which reportedly “at times featured Xavier, plus Iron Man, Mr Fantastic, and Doctor Strange himself” in the comic books. “As you saw in Spider-Man: No Way Home, some rumors ended up being true, some did not,” he shared. “I would love to see Tony again, but some rumours are just rumours. I will say that I love the Illuminati.

The program contained a list of possible recruits, each containing a significant tie to an Avenger or Avenger's history. In a [particular panel](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marveldatabase/images/1/1c/Avengers_Fail-Safe_Program_from_Young_Avengers_Vol_1_3_001.png/revision/latest?cb=20100819043002) in the issue, we see a number of names displayed.

Some we know like: Theodore Altman (Hulking), Elijah Bradley (Patriot), Willi Caplan (Wiccan), and Thomas Shepard (Speed), Josiah Bradley (Josiah X)

However there were plenty on the list who have never since been mentioned... Matthew Bronleewe, Todd Casey, Richard Chung, Anissa Dorsey, Perry Moore, and Robin Parish.

Notably Cassie Lang was missing from the list. I speculate that this was because Vision didn't realize she had abilities. In fact, it wasn't revealed she had abilities until after she made contact with the other Young Avengers. This leads me to believe that the Fail-Safe Program only catalogued those it believed had post-human abilities or skills that would allow them to actually be superheroes.

**Original Plans For Season 2:** 

It's been a while.  I think we had a Nova-focused episode.  Emperor Doom, not Stark.  And the finale was a three-parter wherein the Avengers fought Galactus on Hala.

[https://twitter.com/yost/status/976191955855015936](https://twitter.com/yost/status/976191955855015936)

The very first draft of 'Emperor Stark' was actually a very faithful adaptation of E. Doom, swapping Vision for Wonder Man.  Doom!!!

[https://twitter.com/yost/status/247821850074288129](https://twitter.com/yost/status/247821850074288129)

i set up winter soldier obviously but whatever they did with it in the man of action episodes, that was theirs.  as was deadliest and powerless i think.

[https://twitter.com/yost/status/979558672375230464](https://twitter.com/yost/status/979558672375230464)

i've said this elsewhere but season 2 was originally designed to end with the Avengers defeating Galactus on Hala, as the Supreme Intelligence abandoned the Kree people.

New Avengers took place AFTER Operation Galactic Storm, the New Avengers were needed because the main team was now on the other side of the universe, not because Kang erased them.

Ultron Unlimited was awkward because we'd just done Skrulls, it felt too soon to have robots impersonating our heroes.

and of course Emperor Stark was always meant to be Emperor Doom, and was written as such.

[https://twitter.com/yost/status/1244057873044234241](https://twitter.com/yost/status/1244057873044234241)

Our original plan for the end of Season 2 had 'New Avengers' coming after 'Operation Galactic Storm', with the idea being that after the Avengers collapse the Kree wormhole and prevent the destruction of Earth's sun, the event that obliterated Kang's future Earth is prevented. This immediately causes Ravonna to wake from stasis and she goes on a rampage to free Kang, while the Avengers are stuck halfway across the galaxy. When we were told we needed to make changes to Season 2, one of the things we were asked was to do was to decouple 'New Avengers' from the Kree story and to replace Ravonna with The Council of Kangs in that episode to make it seem more stand-alone. As a result, the Ravonna thread was left hanging, so later on when Chris was working on the comics, he decided to address it.

**Post-Season 3 Plans (Different Ideas From The Two Producers):** 

According to Chris Yost:

but if there WAS a season 4... the first half would be called UNDER SIEGE.  The second half would be INFINITY QUEST.  [\#AvengersEMH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AvengersEMH?src=hashtag_click)

[https://twitter.com/yost/status/1451013481344372739](https://twitter.com/yost/status/1451013481344372739)

**""Under Siege""** is a tour of the Marvel U. during our version of Acts of Vengeance.  It's Dr. Doom marshaling the greatest super-villains on the planet to put the Avengers on the run, lots of international locations, villains and guest stars.  [\#AvengersEMH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AvengersEMH?src=hashtag_click)

**""Infinity Quest""** features the Elders of the Universe as they seek out the Infinity Gems in a bid to end this universe and become gods in the next and would scatter the Avengers across the cosmic Marvel U.  [\#AvengersEMH](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AvengersEMH?src=hashtag_click)

According To Josh Fine:

Maria Hill's story-line and originally the Dell Rusk plot thread were seeds we planted to grow towards super-human registration and Civil War. That likely would have been at least a part of Season 4 if we had gotten that far.

Comics ,False,Wouldn't it be a great idea for a series of comics where in every issue another hero or villain kills all of the heroes of his universe? Like the deadpool kills the marvel universe or the punisher kills the marvel universe,Marvel,... kills the marvel universe
Comics ,False,The question is what marvel character who's a villain that think that they're doing the right thing. Got to tell me why you like them you don't have to be detail . you can just say that they're cool and that's it.,Marvel,what is your favorite villain I think that they're doing the right thing in marvel
Film/Television,False,"Like ""Ultimate Spiderman"".",Marvel,"Are the Marvel animated works (movies, TV works, etc.) faithful to the comics?"
Other,False,"&amp;#x200B;

Film/Television,False,"I mean if venom goes back maybe ends up in Andrew Garfield universe and Vulture is there too along with moribus. Most of the sinster six would be there. And there was rumor kraven wad gonna be black panther but I assumed miles Morales would have made it and teamed up with Chadwick. But that's a no go now and I really don't think they want kraven to hunt shuri. It just don't look right to have a grown hunt a young black woman even if she becomes black panther. Personally marvel should have brought in Hunter shuri other brother to wakanda.

But now Sony is apparently making a kraven movie and I hope he is tasked with hunting costume villains but now they are remade as cool animal hybrids. Like cross species in the amazing spiderman game.",Marvel,The Sinster six verse by sony.
Artwork,False,"I'm looking for dc characters like blade to draw, and was hoping I could get some help.",Marvel,dc characters like blade?
Film/Television,False,"So i'm not a big fan, but i like Marvel. I saw Venom 1 &amp; 2, and i wanted to ask why does he appear on the last scene post-credits in the last spider man movie ? For what i understand, only people that know Peter Parker got teleported, but Venom doesn't know him, so why was he there? Did I miss something?",Marvel,I just have a question about the last scene in Spiderman No Way Home
Film/Television,False,"i mean, in Days of Future and Wolverine finale? Xaiver transported himself in another body, but why he still looks same? thats some simple mind trick so everyone seeing him at usual appearance?",Marvel,why Xaiver didnt change appearance after events of X-Men 3?
Film/Television,False,"Ever since Endgame's Smart Hulk, I feel like fans have been hard on Ruffalo's Hulk. Many have even gone back to the Edward Norton movie and said that's their favorite take on the character. I can respect that, and Ruffalo's Banner/Hulk definitely does take cues from it. But I just wanted to talk about why I love his Banner and Hulk, specifically in the first Avengers. 

A lot of it comes down to the perfect marriage of Ruffalo's performance and Joss Whedon's writing and directing. Banner focuses on helping others despite his own problems, and he tries to have a sense of humor about his life. Despite that, he can be very shrewd and scary when he wants to be. Not just because of the Hulk. This Banner's got a dark side to him. I'm thinking back to when he threatened to ""choke the life"" out of Wanda. Even when Banner admitted he tried to kill himself, it was more so to warn the others that the Hulk can't be stopped. It makes his scenes all the more unsettling when he starts losing his cool. 

Even still, he tries to stay on top of things, and you can see that even in Banner's body language. It's full of beautiful contradictions. He's calm, but he also seems on edge, like he's holding something back. He's very controlled, yet clumsy. In some scenes, you can see how Banner trips over himself. Like he's got some spatial awareness issues from getting big and small so much. Also, I love little details like him being nervous around soldiers because of his past with the US army. 

And then we get to ""The Other Guy"" himself. First off, I love how his first transformation was like a horror movie. We typically see Hulk go up against people that pick on him first - soldiers, monsters, gamma dogs... Here, he's trying to hurt someone we care about in Black Widow. He even battles Thor and, in Age of Ultron, Iron Man, which is my favorite MCU fight. And I love how, in the Chitauri battle, we see how awesome and funny Hulk can be. People forget that a lot of the crowd-pleasing moments from the first Avengers came from him. 

Part of my problem with later depictions of Hulk, besides of Age of Ultron, is how goofy Hulk is. To me, Hulk is funny because of how he undercuts serious moments with his brutishness. You get a little bit of that in Thor: Ragnarok, but... I don't know. Maybe it's because he talks like a big kid. It's comic book accurate, but I prefer the stoic monster-of-a-few-words. 

Anyway, like I said, I just wanted to type this up because I feel like Ruffalo's been given a hard time because of how the Russo Brothers and Markus and McFeely handled his Smart Hulk character arc. For the future, I'm just hoping we can get a Banner and Hulk that's as will-written as he was in the first Avengers again.",Marvel,Mark Ruffalo's Banner/Hulk appreciation
Other,False,"It can either be the comics, MCU movies, and everything in between

Other,False,"In Far From Home, Happy was portrayed as Peter’s new father figure after the death of Tony - and they had many touching moments. However, since he wasn’t as prominent of a character in NWH, the bond wasn’t as strong as it was in FFH (although it was still there, just didn’t get the same screen time).

I guess my point is that the scenes with Happy in NWH are just as tragic, but in the scope of the whole movie and everything Peter had to go through, they don’t seem so bad.

For example:
1. After Aunt May dies and Happy and Peter exchange a heartbreaking glance.
2. At the cemetery, where they both mourn Aunt May. Peter lost yet another father figure, which doesn’t get enough attention as after Tony’s death, the Peter/ Tony bond was passed onto Happy and now that’s gone as well 😢",Marvel,An underrated scene in NWH (in my opinion)

Film/Television,False,"To me...it feels like the lessons learned are completely discarded. Peter was 10 times stronger because of Ned and MJ. The scene on the school roof where they both hug him after losing Aunt May was powerful. It was the support of the other spider-men that kept him from killing Osborn, and helping him come to terms with the loss of May. They helped him keep his humanity.

Not to mention the transformation of MJ and Ned from having known Peter. MJ was an antisocial pessimist, who became someone more optimistic and hopeful. Ned became the guy in the chair, his dream, and found out that he's a natural with magic. All of that character progression is wiped out.

I hate that Peter made a promise to those most important to him, and without giving them a choice, decided what was best for them. 

But yeah...the lesson that you can be stronger with support, and to respect your friends is totally dashed, and Peter has doomed himself to the same fate as the other 2 spider-men. Keeping those you care about at a distance because of some self imposed need to protect them. It's frankly selfish, and it felt like the complete wrong direction for this version of Peter.

It just sucks. And people say it's good because it's a clean slate for Peter. Great, a clean slate for him to just bear the weight of being Spider-Man alone. Good grief.",Marvel,[spoilers] I still really hate the ending of No Way Home...

Fan Made,False,"If I was to do a fantastic four movie for the mcu

ACT ONE-

This movie would start with a flashback to tony stark giving a guest speech at a local collage, with Ben grim, (before civil war) reed Richard’s, and Susan storm. Asking him questions after the guest lecture. With Susan storm leaving because she promised her parents that she would watch her little brother for them. And reed asks mr.stark a kinda cliché question like “what advice would you give to any new entrepreneurs” and tony would say something like “always take the risk” and the scene would end with reed calling Susan to ask her on a date. Next after a title sequence, it would cut to reeds trying to convince Ben to help him with his spacecraft project. And would have them start working on the ship, (after end game) then it would cut to a scene to doctor doom before he has his suit walking into a ancient cave within latveria. Then he enters a lab in the cave with him opening a brief case with a full metal suit similar to the mk-0 suit but a lot slimmer. And him putting it on with the cape, then a American spy trying to interfere with dr.doom using magic to absolutely crushing the agent. Then cutting back to reeds lab with the rocket built and reed Richard’s giving a speech to potential investors, to promote his “first ever super sonic rocket witch can get people to the moon in less than a day”. Until one man stands up and asks has it been tested, then reed looking kind of embarrassed and saying it hasn’t. Then all of the investors get up to leave. Then in a moment of desperation reed Richard’s says “but it will start testing in a week” this causes the same man who asked the question to say,”you have 14 days to get it tested or no money” then leaving 

ACT TWO-


This act starts with Richard’s and storm convincing Ben to fly the spacecraft but refusing (as he only has experience with small aircrafts) but with him ultimately agreeing. Then it cuts to launch day, with Jonny storm begging Richard’s to let him go on the rocket with reeds saying no multiple times. With Jonny sneaking in to the rocket, then the rocket launches and all is going according to plan until there is a paneling error and cosmic rays leek in and make Ben grim pass out then leading to them crashing. (I would put a Easter egg here being that they crash were the hulk crashed in the first avengers movie) they crash and end up in the hospital, they wake up and for the most part reed and sue are mostly fine but they won’t release Jonny and Ben for a odd reason the hospital won’t explain until all of a sudden all of the fire alarms go off and an explosion happens. Then sue and reed run to the fire exit just to see Jonny on fire flying and screaming, and then shields  forces bring in the four to the h.q.

ACT THREE-the scene starts with reed and sue discovering there powers, and a voice over the intercom asking all personal to escort the fantastic four program to the interrogation room and it cuts to all of the group in the interrogation room. Then it reveals that nick fury is alive, and nick starts asking the hero’s about a  avengers nex program. (I’d have a nod to the next hero’s for the program like Shang-chai, falcon, and she hulk), the scene would end with the hero’s trying to turn down fury and end up with them heading to their rooms. Then it would cut to dr.doom in his room watching the news story about the hospital problem with Jonny storm, then it would have doom reveal he’s very paranoid about the u.s. invading his country after the spy incident. So he decide to jump the gun and storm shield h.q. kidnap Jonny storm, then the reed, sue, and Ben making a deal that if he helps them get back Jonny. So nick does that and is able to receive info on a possible ship that could transfer Jonny to latveria. (This scene would build the characters of reed, sue, and bens characters)
They now use their powers to sneak onto the boat using their powers ( with the help of nick fury) to get onto the ship as latveria is completely inaccessible by air or grand. (I would put a joke about reed could tell nick that they could just dress the thing up as a pirate as a nod to their earlier comics)

ACT FOUR- the scene would start with dr. Doom being informed that there is a break in to his ship so he gets prepared in his suit. Then it would cut to sue storm saving Jonny. And everyone meeting at the deck of the ship to encounter just to meet dr. Doom and latveria armed forces, the fantastic four hold of the army of latveria very well with the help of sue storms force fields. But they have a lot of trouble with dr.doom and his magic so Jonny flys up to dr.doom and almost kills him self overheating dr dooms suits battery and ultimately melding the suit and doom together. And the movie ending with sue calling themselves the fantastic four

For example: In the original Thor comics it’s stated that Odin found Loki as a baby and as an adult he refers to Hel as his daughter.

Other,False,"In the Marvel Universe, I notice that the aliens shown are very humanoid, and almost exactly identical to Earth people. Species like Skrulls, Frost Giants, Dark Elves, Korbinites, Dwarves, Chitauri, Titans, etc, are humanoid with some notable differences to them. And species like the Zehoberei, Krylorians, Kylosians, Sovereign, Centaurians, Luphomoids, Easik, Kree(mostly), etc, have various skin colors. But species like Xandarians, Asgardians, and Grandmaster/Collector are pretty much identical to humans. They even all speak English, but that’s really for the viewers sake. What are the odds that such similar species would occur on another planet? It kinda makes me think they all had to have come from a common ancestor species of humanoid, and evolved over time to adapt. That could mean that all of these species could be sexually compatible (Ego found that one out). Or maybe humans were aliens that came to earth, but that couldn’t explain how humans have similar genes to other Earth creatures like animals, and that life forms similar to Earth’s creatures occur on other worlds (Orloni, Kymellians, F’Saki, Flerkens, Duckworldians). The Deviants in the Eternals movie were a change from the ones in the comics. I liked the change, because the Deviants resembled the predatory lifeforms on the planets they were on, which made sense that they would adapt that way. (Thanos is a Eternal/Titan, not created by Celestials, with a Deviant gene, which is why he looks the way he looks). So maybe humans on earth went to space a long time ago, and evolved and inhabited other worlds (creation of Pluvians in the comics)? Unlikely. Humans didn’t get to space until around the 1950s, and they would’ve more needed time to adapt and evolve. Time dilation doesn’t seem to exist in Marvel, so it’s not easy to answer that part. I partially thought that Hydra’s experiments with the Space Stone could’ve sent certain people into space, like it did with Red Skull. It could explain why some humanlike alien species are so racially diverse. But how would the other species be so much more advanced than Earth? There’s many ways to think about it, and it goes deeper the more you do. 

I think maybe the Celestials created a “blueprint species”, and sent them to inhabit the planets they created. The Celestials made a variety of that blueprint species, that would evolve into the different kinds of aliens seen in their Universe. And Celestials would come back to their created worlds to tamper with things a bit, so they could’ve made some changes after the creation of their new species. That is how the Mutants were created. Mythology states that Odin created humans, but the “gods” in Marvel aren’t gods, just viewed as gods. They are all still mortal. So they are basically just superpowered aliens. And almost every mythology exists in Marvel. The stories of the gods were created on Earth by Sprite and their illusion storytelling. Also when the Asgardians fought the Frost Giants on earth and they saw them as gods. And creatures seen as “mythical” on earth, so exist in other worlds, like in the 7 Realms. But the other gods are mortal. They are basically insignificant compared to the Celestials.

Symbiotes are a different story, as they weren’t created by the Celestials, they were created by Knull.

DC has a similar thing with the human-aliens look, but I don’t know how that works and what their versions of the Celestials are. But the Kryptonians are basically same as humans.

However, years ago I heard from a friend that there was an appendix to the ""What If"" story that apparently showed up somewhere...and I've never found it.

However, he discovers the Ultimate Nullifier floating out there in the void, or non-void, or whatever you call the absence of a universe.  He takes the Nullifier and does some logic: ""Since the Universe was nullified with the Ultimate Nullifier, then if I use the Nullifier again and focus on this non-universe, will this bring the Universe back?""  But then one of the cosmic guardians of the multiverse - maybe the Living Tribunal? - appears and says to Dr. Strange, ""NO, DUDE, YOU DON'T DO THAT.""

Comics ,False,"Hi there. I was hoping to find a good/complete list of what the original print trade order (all titles/names/volume numbers and in order) for Aaron's Thor run was. Ive tried finding reading orders online, but most have updated to the more modern complete collections, and reprints, which may be handy for some, but I found a surplus store thats selling the originals for real cheap, and I just want to make sure they have them all before committing. Thanks!",Marvel,What was the trade reading order for the Jason Aaron Thor run?
Film/Television,False,"Upon rewatching the series in the episode I Am Spiderman, Coulson pulls up a list of candidates best to play him in the play. On the list, Flash Thompson, who is selected to star is first since he's a fan, until the villain Trapster crashes the play and Parker has to come in. Second on the list is Sam Alexander, Peter's rival. Third is freaking Ava Ayala, who is a girl ha ha. Fourth is the one that caught my eye and intrigued me. It's Miles Morales, and it's technically the very first mention of him on the show, and we technically don't see him until Season 3 I believe when he appears. Miles in the picture also looks older which leads me to think he's Peter's age or close, maybe even older. So there is a Miles in the main universe, pretty cool, and coincidentally the Spiderman of anther universe was a candidate for playing Spiderman in a play. And comically enough Peter Parker is fifth on the list.

Another interesting thing is that Trapster technically might have known about Parker being Spiderman, but since he was crashing a play he was under the impression that there may have been multiple actors as Spiderman since he saw both Parker and Flash. It's odd that he didn't bother to further explore Spiderman's identity or having the assumption that just maybe either Flash or Parker could possibly be the real Spiderman since the Frightful Four confirmed that Spiderman is a Midtown student. But still. And it's pretty hilarious that the episode ended with Flash's singing being so bad that Trapster's goggles and the school windows got destroyed.",Marvel,Pretty hilarious easter egg/reference from Ultimate Spiderman.

Film/Television,False,"Right now i’m reading through Lee / Ditko’s Doctor Strange run, and in the run Dormammu is the deadliest Doctor Strange who he loses to from time to time. He, alongside Mordo, would tirelessly hunt down Strange across the Earth while he was on the run. I think the movie dropped the ball on Dormammu and wasted there potential of his character. He isn’t a one and some villain, he is one of the recurring villains of Strange. So why didn’t the movie treat him as such?",Marvel,Why did the movie franchise waste Dormammu?

Other,False,"Spiderman and Batman are both one of the most popular superheroes of all time. Both of them have had huge impact on superhero genre, especially during the 90s and 2000s. There are a lot of things that make people love both of these character.

In some ways, you can say that both the characters are pretty similar. Both of them have lost their parents at an early age, are smart, are mostly street-level crime fighters, are not into killing their enemies, and are able to have bunch of love interests.

Which makes me wonder, if you had to pick a Batman Storyline from any of his comics, which one would you pick for Spiderman (obviously changing some bits to match the Spiderman setting)?",Marvel,"If you had to pick a Batman Storyline for Spiderman, which one would you pick?"
Games,False,I just bought the game for my switch 2 days ago and I love it so far. When I was very young I had the first two games on my PSP and had a great time.

It’s easy from my POV to be flummoxed when some people say Venom isn’t actually all that bad and has actually done good deeds.

Comics ,False,"Hey there, I was wondering about Jubilee lately. I used to read comic books (and X-Men in particular) in the late 90s and not much more since then, and when I met Jubilee then, she was that goofy, funny mutant without huge or even (sorry if I'm wrong) useful powers. But except doing pranks and jokes with her team mates I've never seen her in other situation. What did I miss? Cause it appears that everybody loves her, she's always around when you talk about favorite X people. Is there a specific comic book arc where she shines, or is it just love for a side character who made good jokes at some point? Thanks for the answers.",Marvel,Why all this love for Jubilee?
Film/Television,False,"The concept of Black Panther is that a ""might makes right"" style country in which literally the strongest person becomes king somehow has a benevolent elderly ruler and a royal lineage, and this nation developed faster individually than the rest of the world did collectively because a meteor landed with a really hard rock inside.

And I've accepted that.

But- Shuri brings up a casual ""What are those?"" when pointing to T'Challa's shoes, meaning that she both knows of a western meme and knows the proper context in which to use it. 

So now I'm going to go into the history of the meme.

It originates from June 14th, 2015, in Berkley California, in a video where a police officer is arresting a woman, and a teenager runs up to ask the officer ""What are those?"" as a kind of anti-authority statement. This was very briefly used against various authority figures on varios western social medias, then vanished into the aether where all memes go after the internet moves on, to be brought up by corporations to try to ""connect with the youth"" but like... way to late and contextually slightly off. In this case, Shuri was actually correctly using it against authority, but she was actually using it as an honest question because he was wearing open toed sandals in a lab setting.

Cool.

What this means is that Shuri has access to international social networks, and at the time Black Panther came out (2018), she had been active on them for at least 3 full years. Social networks collect ""cookies"" that show browsing data and your nation of origin to give to customers. This is why you order a thing from Amazon and you get 50 different ads for a different thing. Cockroach poison isn't something I buy for fun, it's a practical necessity!

Anyways, these can be subverted by using a VPN. These make it appear as if you're somewhere else, and Wakanda is absolutely technologically advanced to have a fast national VPN array, but what that would do is inflate the percieved population of other nations. Let's say Wakanda just used Zimbabwe as a proxy. Zimbabwe has a population of 14 million, but Wakanda has a population of apparently 6 million, and they're rich so they're more likely to be using the internet. That could nearly double the internet usage in Zimbabwe, which could blow Wakanda's whole cover.

Or they could have proxies set up all over the world, but finding one, again, threatens to blow the whole operation, and Wakandans do not seem to hide incredibly well in public. Professional soldier and infiltrator Okoye lost her temper at a guy in one sentence in the one infiltration scene we saw in Black Panther, and in many cases, their warriors walk around in high tech flashy red armor in like the middle of Europe or something.

I'm just saying, if Wakanda didn't out itself, their collective search histories would have done it for them.",Marvel,A deeply overthought look into a joke from Black Panther and its implications on fictional technology.

Fan Made,False,"Hey, guys.  I had this idea for an Iron Man TV series and I wanted to see what you thought of it.  The show would be called Iron Man: Legacy.

While testing a high-tech drone in Sokovia(a former part of the Soviet Union) 23 year-old playboy inventor Tony Stark and his bodyguard James Rhodes are taken hostage by Russian terrorists led by Colonel Valentin Shatalov.  Basically, it's like Arrow where there are flashbacks to when Tony was in captivity.  Shatalov is revealed to be a member of a clandestine organization called the Ten Rings, and he has a vendetta against both the United States and Stark Enterprises because the US military used Stark weapons to kill his family.  Shatalov manipulates Tony's hatred for his father, Howard Stark, to recruit Tony to help him take revenge on Stark Enterprises.  Shatalov trains Tony in martial arts and military skills, but Tony discovers that Shatalov is a war criminal and a manipulator, so Tony builds the Iron Man armor and uses to escape Sokovia with Rhodes. 

Upon returning home, Tony begins to investigate the conspiracy against him, while using the high-tech and sleek version of his Iron Man armor to fight crime and terrorism.  He fights the Maggia crime family, who are led by Madame Masque and an individual known only as ''The Count''.  Iron Man also battles Justin Hammer, Whiplash, Titanium Man, Ezekiel Stane, Taskmaster(portrayed as the top assassin of the Ten Rings) and AIM(portrayed as a high-tech splinter group of the Ten Rings).  SHIELD plays an important role.

Eventually, Tony learns that Howard Stark is the leader of the Ten Rings and had Tony abducted to try to recruit him.  Howard controls Shatalov and the Russian Ultranationalists as well.  Howard and the. Ten Rings plan to rewrite the world order by igniting World War Three between the US and Russia, wiping out much of the world's population.  Iron Man fights Shatalov's army of Russian terrorists, who are equipped with battle armors and Stark weapons and are attacking Washington DC.  Tony prevents WW3 by fighting his father, who is wearing a massive and heavily-armed ''War Machine'' armor.

In the second season, Tony continues fighting the Ten Rings and AIM, eventually confronting the real leader of the Ten Rings:  The Mandarin, an immortal warlord seeking to bring his army back from the dead and restore his empire.  Tony, without his armor, duels with the Mandarin, but loses.  However, Tony and his allies(including SHIELD) wage all-out war on the Mandarin's army, preventing the Apocalypse in the process.

Basically, the Ten Rings are more like the League of Shadows from Batman, and this show takes a lot of inspiration from Arrow and Batman Begins.  What do you think?",Marvel,Iron Man: Legacy TV Show Concept

Film/Television,False,"So I had a hard time finding an updated time so decided to make my own and figured I'd share. I originally made this list for a friend who wants to watch everything but didn't know where to start. This list includes all films, tv series, and one-shots in the cannon with both chronological and release order, and a list of upcoming releases. I also included the Spider-Man multiverse and X-Men films in case anyone wants to watch those as well, even if they aren't cannon or in the MCU. Yes, I also added the Venom movies to the timeline (where I felt they best fit, but I may need to move them around a bit) since the second one kinda made a tie-in with the after credit scene, but as of yet aren't really cannon. The ""Team Thor/Team Darryl"" one shots aren't technically cannon so I left them outside of the timeline, but included the media releases so if you want to watch those, they'd make the most sense after each of those films.

Let me know if I made any mistakes or if I should rearrange anything, especially because there's so much content I probably missed something or put something out of order. You really only have to watch the movies for the timeline to make sense but for anyone wanting to get into the expanded universe, I hope this helps.

Comics ,False,"I will admit I read the clone saga maybe once a million years ago and didn't think it was good.  Been reading the recent Beyond storyline in the Spidey comics and very much enjoying it but I'm a bit confused about Ben's origin/back story.

My understanding has always been that Peter got cloned and Ben is that clone.  There was confusion about who was the original (insert Spider-man pointing gif here) and once it got sorted that Ben was the clone he took the name Ben and went off on his own.  Reading the Beyond saga they seem to hint that Ben is the original and Peter is the clone?  But this makes no sense at all.  The Peter I've been reading about is a clone with all the memories of the original Peter?  So MJ fell in love with the original Pete and when the original Pete thought he was a clone and went off elsewhere, MJ just stayed in love and married to clone Pete and didn't care?  And Black Cat and many others just did the same?  Or am I wildly misunderstanding this?  Or is it better off if I just don't think about it?",Marvel,Trying to understand/place Ben Reilly's backstory

Comics ,False,"I fully believe Ms Marvel can and should be the new Spider-Man, or at least the closest Marvel has to a hero with the same feel and popularity as Spidey. That's how much faith I have in Kamala Khan. The problem is that Marvel doesn't seem to share my feelings, as they've done nothing but undercut Kamala's potential at every turn. 

Here's the thing. I know G. Willow Wilson's run was a huge success, of course. She made the character who she is today and deserves all the credit and more. The problem is, ever since that run ended, Marvel has been hellbent on replicating it exactly the same, and so they've kept Kamala locked in the same box, telling the same kind of stories, with the same exact tone and feel as Wilson's (even visually; every Ms Marvel series has the similar art and color palette to the original run). 

I was super excited back when Saladin Ahmed was announced as the new Ms Marvel writer. I couldn't wait for him to use his high-concept sci-fi stylish sensibilities from his excellent ""Black Bolt"" series on Ms Marvel. But in the end, his run was just a tepid follow-up of Wilson's, again the same feel and tone and style. No ambitious scope or ideas, just a retread of the same. And the current miniseries by Samira Ahmed is even more basic. 

I said Ms Marvel can be the next Spider-Man, and I stand by that. But Spider-Man didn't get to be the hero he's today by staying narratively stagnant. Arcs like ""The Night That Gwen Stacy Died"" made the character grow, added depth and weight to him and offered a change in terms of the tone and the type of stories that could be told about the character. I don't mean that Marvel should kill off Bruno or Kamala's parents just to make a point. Dark and bleak don't necessarily equal growth. But there are so many other stories you could tell with Kamala, so many ways you could make the character grow and change and mature. Give me a risky, out of the box pitch for a Ms Marvel series, something new, something different to reinvigorate the character. 

It's ironic that for a character whose powers are embiggening and shape-shifting Marvel wants to keep her the same.",Marvel,Kamala Khan can be one of the greatest comic characters but Marvel is to afraid to let her grow and change

Other,False,"There are a lot of characters in Marvel that sort of weave in and out of being in any kind of a spotlight. I can think of a number that could be used much better just off the top of my head. 

But I am curious as to who other Marvel fans would like to see more of, either in comics or in the MCU even. And since it's my topic I will give my short list... I will leave a slight explanation for each, but feel free to just lost.

Nocturne - I absolutely loved Exiles, it had such an amazing potential. Nocturne was my absolute favorite in terms of powers, personality, and character look. I kind of felt she got the short end of the stick in Excalibur by randomly having a stroke. 

Black Cat - Yes she pops up a lot, yes she has had her own series, but I think she has always been tied to directly to Peter in terms of breaking out as a character. She has as much personality as Peter and I think if she was given a run that had very little to do with him she could shine. 

Mockingbird - I really liked her solo a few years back and couldn't understand why it came to such an abrupt end. I mean reasonably I understand sales and what not, but I was left with so many questions. I would love to see more of her as an Avenger, Defender, Ultimate whatever I just would like her story to be continued and expanded. 

Mimic - Either the 616 version or the Exiles version of the character would be very interesting. If the MCU wants to do a different set of X-Men from Fox I think he would be a good addition as either Brotherhood or X-Men. I get he comes off as a bit overpowered but I think he makes up with it in personality. 

Collectively the Inhumans - I am the first one in line to admit that what Marvel tried with Inhumans replacing X-Men was a terrible idea. I think trying them again without it being a plot to take the place of a more popular team would be beneficial. I think it has been a long enough span of time to get the bad taste of people's mouths. 

And last more magical characters. In general I think that magic is very underserved in Marvel Comics. There are a number of cool characters with magical powers but the science based heroes are just the majority. One man's opinion I suppose. Let me know your thoughts though. I am genuinely interested in characters people like who may have fallen to the wayside.",Marvel,Who is a character you want to see more?

Comics ,False,"I understand super-genius characters in comics book are completely unrealistic when it comes to their intelligence and their mastery of multiple fields acquired in normal human lifespan.

At least Marvel writers weren't dumb enough to have characters  be geniuses in EVERY single scientific field. I'm fine with Tony being an engineering genius with skills in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. I don't expect him to be capable of curing cancer or turning a Mutant into a human using his knowledge in biology since  that's not where his expertise lies at.

Hank Pym is just a complete fucking mess. He has expertise in biochemistry, quantum mechanics, artificial intelligence, entomology. Honestly, what  a bunch of random fields to be an expert at. His also a physician to top  it all of.  Even if he had completed an MD-PHD ( which is a real thing)  and had his PHD in biochemistry, how does get any type of exposure to those other fields?",Marvel,Hank Pym's skillset is just bizarre.

And although I liked the idea of seeing Peter become the true spider-man throughout his trilogy, I cannot stop thinking about what could have been if he already was his true self and if the films were less... marvel-like.

I vastly prefer marvel over dc but one thing I've loved about the suicide squad and the batman, is the fact that they are indeed set in dc universes, maybe not the main one, but they are, but aren't really worried about continuity. They focus on telling their story, with the director's unique vision and they can handle continuity issues later.

Having spider-man in the mcu and not including other heroes would be a mistake, even in comics, he was always the face of team-up books. But I would prefer them focusing more on street level crime, since the avengers already got major perils covered and the heroes he interacts with being people like Daredevil with the occasional avenger. We are also yet to see organized crime in spider-am movies, Kingpin, Tombstone, Hammerhead, Mr Negative...

I watched The Batman yesterday and loved it. It grounded batman a bit more and truly felt like a love letter to the character. 


And I think it would be interesting if marvel gave someone the freedom to direct their own spiderman movies in this way, although the best chance of us getting that would probably be through animated stuff or simply by continuing the game series.

In a **TL;DR** fashion: ***I think this character (or Writer -- whatever you call it) is losing it's gravitas the more Marvel shoves him into every issue. Instead of it being a hyped-up moment that you see God himself, it'll soon be for the reader -- ""Oh, yeah, One-Above-All is here... anyway--""***  

***(Longer Read)*** What I mean exactly by 'too many appearances' is that God is starting to become trivial and uninteresting. While he isn't being shown every other issue -- the frequency of the appearances is rising. Worse still (even if it is in Starlin's fanfiction) he is shown to have weaknesses.

The whole gist in TOAA is that it is a mysterious force that you can't fully understand, but now it is portrayed as just another Monotheistic God in fiction. And the thing is -- the more you show a character like this, the less interesting and mysterious they become. The whole gig with The Tribunal (at least in present continuity) was to be TOAA's right hand. The being that speaks for him.

Other,False,"This is something I’ve been wondering lately. I still consider myself a fan of the MCU even if I think they need to radically shake up their style more often, but it concerns me that almost *everything* Marvel related is now fully connected to a single universe with the same general massive-scale blockbuster style. The Fox movies and Marvel TV offered some variety to those who maybe wanted something different but now it’s all under one umbrella and while that can be good I’d imagine it can be disappointing to longtime Marvel fans who just can’t get into what Marvel Studios has been doing. DC right now at least has some more variety of tones and styles across all their platforms.

While I know the comics and games aren’t connected at the moment, outside of Spider-Man the movies have been having a massive influence on other Marvel-related media, so it’s like you can’t escape it.

I think this is more unfair look at the his type than at himself. Darkseid and Morgoth, for example, are exact type like him, but they are not considered bad villains at all.

Comics ,False,"It doesn't make much sense that humans would think that building Sentinels would be a good idea to protect humanity from mutants since they constantly turn on their creators. During their first appearance ever on live TV what did they do? They immediately go rogue and attack their creator and everytime since then they always turn on the humans they were supposed to protect. Sometimes it's this human sided with a mutant or a human can theoretically be the ancestor of a mutant in the future so we're nipping this in the bud, but the most insane argument is that humans who have a slight deviation from a default human like have green eyes is a mutat. So why would humans keep trusting Sentinels to keep them safe. It would be like if the when the Wright Brothers invented the first plane it came to life and ate one of them and started flying around town eating people off the streets. No sane person would ever build another and if they did it would just do the same thing the original ones did.",Marvel,Why do people keep building Sentinels?
Film/Television,False,"Probably not going to have a team-up, but they have written a replacement for every member of the original Avengers (or at least announced one) at this point.

**Peter Parker**

Seems to be the Iron Man replacement. He's good. I think Tom Holland is a good actor, and he comes with very different baggage than Tony did, which is nice. I think he can have some fun interactions with the other characters. I don't really have anything in particular to say because it's Spider Man and everyone pretty much knows what to expect.

**Sam Wilson** 

He's the only character on this list with actual military leadership experience, so that's a weird quirk of giving everyone an origin story from scratch. He's kind of flawless right now, so I'm hopeful that in the future we can show some more of this guy's baggage.

**Ylena Belova**

She is so good. My gosh. She played such a little sister in Black Widow, but when she showed up in Hawkeye, she was honestly a bit scary. I think she definitely gives me more of a ""viable threat at all times"" vibe than Natasha did, but gives me way less of a ""could blend into a crowd"" vibe. I love every moment she's on screen.

**Kate Bishop**

I thought it was Cait or Cate at first, because she abbreviates things CB and I'm deeply confused. She was very fun to watch as well, because she's creative with how she deals with problems. I think if she's featured alongside actual superpowered characters, she'd slouch nicely into the ""I have an idea"" role, that everybody is a little scared by because the idea is nuts.

**Jane Foster**

She was okay in Thor but I think she's going to need some Ragnarok treatment and get a kind of soft character rewrite before I'm really convinced that she can do the Thor stuff. I mean, she's fine, but she was the audience surrogate character in a ""worlds collide"" story in the first Thor, so her personality was sort of subdued to allow Thor to be as weird as he needed to be. I'm curious how that interpretation will change in the next movie.

**She-Hulk**

I've never been a massive She-Hulk fan, because she misses out on the grotesque transformation and uncontrollable destruction stuff that makes the Hulk so interesting. I think a lot of modern Hulk retellings kind of lose that element of ""being a gigantic monster is scary"", so really she's a normal person with a cool transformation, which is fine but it's not like she's different from any other super powerful character, so it's all down to how she's written.

I do sincerely hope that she doesn't wind up in the purple and white onesie like right away. At least let being a gigantic green person be weird for a bit.",Marvel,My thoughts on the second generation Avengers

Film/Television,False,"In order of release!

**Wandavision**

This one was brilliant for the most part. I love the building mystery and reuse of some really unexpected characters (who expected Randall Park to be important after Ant Man 2?) The ending was only okay, but the rest was absolutely fantastic. Bonus points to whoever did the costuming, they're a mad genius.

I thought this would be Vision's Send-Off (as one of the four characters that definitely wouldn't be returning after Endgame), but then he just... came back. I guess he just needed some repairs.

It was impossible to accurately predict Agatha as the villain with the evidence provided though. They built up so well to Wanda being the source of the issue, but they go out of their way to give confirmation that it's not Agatha in the Halloween episode, then back out of it later.

**Falcon and the Winter Soldier**

It's hard to be the next thing after Wandavision. This one felt more like a standard Marvel movie, but longer. That's not to say it was bad by any means, but it did have some weird bits. John Walker had a redemption way too soon, the speech at the end was well written but the scenario in which it occurs feels a bit forced, and to be honest, the new Captain America suit makes the shield pretty irrelevant. I mean, if his whole suit is as strong as the shield, why is he even using the shield? My highlights for this one were definitely the moments of downtime where Falcon and the Winter Soldier just have normal conversations.

This being the send-off and passing the cowl for Captain America was a fun way of doing things, and they definitely made up some solid reasons for why very normal Sam Wilson can do as well as roided up Steve Rogers, and why they couldn't just roid up whoever else.

Action scenes in this were probably the best in the whole lineup of series.

**What if**

My gosh this is brutal. They'd kill off characters all over the place because they could. The existence of Loki also makes this one retroactively impossible, which is a bit weird. Incredible animation. I think some animators undervalue the power of proper lighting, this show uses it to great effect.

**Loki**

In a self-contained bubble, this show is fantastic. I like every character, and Tom Hiddleston did fantastic in literally every scene. This is a show that built a status quo that they could have made an entire series around every single episode, then destroyed that status quo within one episode. It was crazy how many fantastic ideas they threw on the fire to keep the plot going, and I have a ton of respect for them for their restraint.

Honestly though, any show where Tom Hiddleston gets to scream at the people of Pompeii that they'll definitely die and there's nothing that they can do with honest glee is a good show.

**Hawkeye**

Like Falcon and the Winter Soldier, this one felt like a more standard Marvel movie, but the competing personalities of the two leads were used to a greater effect, and I feel like the redemption arcs at play were more earned. Also, Ylena steals the stage in everything she's in. I hope we see more of her and Cate Bishop in the future.

This was definitely the part 2 of the Black Widow send-off, where some of her closer connections could actually deal with the emotional damage that came from her dying. At this point, we've successfully mourned the Endgame casualties. I also like how Black Widow and Hawkeye focus on the real impact of fighting a battle with superhumans. In 2012, they definitely didn't seem like they'd have as easy of a time as Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk, but it didn't seem to have an immediate impact back then.",Marvel,I finally got Disney Plus- here are my thoughts on the series.

There are  a lot of current Marvel heroes and villains with Soviet theming and backgrounds, and due to sliding timescale weirdness technically the Cold War was a big part of early Marvel history.

Did the Soviet Union collapse when it really did in real life with a lot more institutions (Red Room, Winter Soldier program), and iconography remaining in a much stronger way than in our world? Do we treat the Soviet Union collapse as having happened a lot later than in the real world? With the basic rule of thumb that 4 years of real time equates to one year passed in 616, did the Soviet Union only collapse around 8 years ago in 616?

Not that it reeeally matters, but more curious from a worldbuilding perspective. There was recently the retcon to add in the the fictional [Siancong War](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Siancong_War) to replace references to the Vietnam War in different characters' backgrounds, so I'm a little curious how changes like that might extend to other elements of Earth-616.",Marvel,When did the Soviet Union collapse in 616?

Comics ,False,"I'm not up to date on any comic currently, so a lot of my knowledge is second-hand at *best*, but I know that (unless it's been retconned) Mutants are the way they are due to possessing the X-Gene which Mutants can either be born with having there Mutant Powers active, or it can remain dormant until later in life like when they reach adolescence and that meta-textually speaking they are meant to be a sort of superhero stand-in for oppressed minority groups and have known about them since I was a kid, but I assume Inhumans' powers manifest differently?

The first introduction I ever had to Inhumans, on the other hand, was the first *Marvel Ultimate Alliance* game when I was a teenager years ago, where I first learned about Black Bolt who lives on the Earth's moon or something? And that he can't speak because his voice is so devastating that even a single utterance of a word could tear massive damage throughout the terrain?

After that I kind of forgot about them until the *Inhumans vs. X-Men* event which I didn't read because I got pissed off and refused to buy any issues after learning that Marvel was pushing to replace the X-Men and Mutants as a whole with them to vote with my wallet. I'd also heard that they were framed in the crossover versus event as morally correct despite trying to literally gas Mutants (Marvel's stand-in for real-world minorities) to death with both the characters and the narrative unironically bizarelly painting Cyclops as ""literally Hitler"" for trying to *prevent* said genocide against Mutants from persisting? To be honest that whole kerfuffle is actually *the* reason that I avoided Inhumans content for so long until recently.

I heard that a lot of this particular storyline was because Marvel (Ike Perlmutter, specifically,) was having seller's remorse regarding giving the film and television rights of the X-Men to 20th Century FOX and this was their way of being petty over it by attempting to 'diminish the brand's value in the eyes of consumers' or something out of spite--while greenlighting a TV show for the *Inhumans* that apparently wasn't very good due to a myriad of production issues like originally allegedly being planned as an IMAX film before being suddenly being shifted to a TV series with a mere pittance given for its production budget that severely limited it. 

So, do Inhumans actually hate Mutants just like regular Humans do in the Marvel universe? Was that always the case or did that only *become* a thing due to corporate politics? And if so, do they *still* hate Mutants post-*Inhumans vs. X-Men*? What is there stance on regular/non-superpowered Humans?

Or is *Inhumans vs. X-Men* more of a *One More Day* type deal where there are blatant character assassinations, plot contrivances, and retcons because an executive was being stubborn?

If so, then can any Inhumans fans set the record straight for me--or give me give me a good jumping on point to understand the Inhumans better in a more accurate portrayal? 

The only other Inhumans aside from Black Bolt that I'm kind of vaguely aware of are Medusa because I remember criticisms of her hair looking terrible in the live-action and that it got cut not long after the first episode to reduce Special Effects costs, the dog monster (Lockjaw?), and Kamala Khan--who replaced Carol Danvers as Ms. Marvel and has Mister Fantastic's stretching powers (I think?

I also have no idea how comics work - since all I ever read in my life is manga - so is it the same? Are any of X-Men published comics still ongoing? How will I be able to know if they are?

Other,False,"1st Dissociative identity disorder I'll shorten it too DID*  was once known as multiple personality disorder. Also I'm not 100 that this is correct but just a thought I had and was interested in other views and thoughts on it. 

2nd I'm mainly knowledgeable on the Spider-Man cartoon from 94 and the newer movies. So other points from other eras of cartoons/movies/comics are welcome. 

3rd mainly talking about Peter Parker Spider-Man but thoughts on other Spider-Man based characters welcome. I also think venom has the same disorder, I did have a section on venom but deleted it because I wanted to look some things up and get better talking points.

So I was watching the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon just started it by the way which made me think back to Spider-Man 94 and I noticed that when Spider-Man is the hero Spider-Man he refers to himself as Spider-Man or Spidey web head or something spider related. Whenever he's peter Parker he mainly refers to himself as parker or something related to Peter Parker. In both series and the few Spider-Man comics I've read. 

The thought of Batman popped into my head and how he only refers to himself as Batman all the time in his head (Batman beyond not sure what episode he gets kidnapped in short tells Terry he only calls himself Batman not bruce wayne also I think the animated batman cartoon from 94 he gets put in a dream state says the same thing to Robin or Batgirl.) Which made me think about how all the Batman characters are based on personality disorders and mental health conditions. 

So back to Spider-Man I think he's found a balance with his DID* where he can balance the two personalities for the most part but Spider-Man wins over Parker more often than not as shown by parker's life always coming in second to Spider-Man's. He also constantly talks to himself which could actually be Spider-Man talking to Parker or vice versa. Parker calls out Spider-Man for his mistakes and not always using his head but physical abilities and Spider-Man talks smack to Parker for being a weak uncool nerd whenever he messes up. 

In Spider-Man 94 opening credits was a scene from an episode where Spider-Man and venom are pulling Peter Parker like tug-0-war to see who will win and gain control of him. Could that have been a representation of a 3rd personality trying to take over kick out Spider-Man? Spider-Man and Parker beat out venom tho to regain that balance. could venom symbiote being a parasite be a representation the felling you get of something feeding off you when you're depressed and how the venom symbiote mainly attacks mentally unhealthy/unstable people examples Peter Parker, Eddie Brock , carnage to Cletus Kasady?

1.) Have a few main titles like Spider-Man, X-Men, Avengers, Fantastic Four, etc, where they have their own adventures.

After Tony asks Thanos how he knows him, Thanos says he was cursed with knowledge. I assumed that he was referring to the effect of the soul stone, given that it was just after he received the stone. I figured that the soul stone gave him at least some level of knowledge about the souls that he interacted with or possibly even every soul, thus cursing him with knowledge.

It may seem far fetched, but I can’t really think of a better reason as to even include these lines. I can see how he could be referring to the fact that he just “knows” he has to cut life in half to save the universe. I just think the fact that he referenced being cursed with knowledge in tandem with knowing Tony Stark when he’s just some smart troubling human in Thanos’ mind, would just not make as much sense to me.

Even further, for Thanos to describe something as a curse must make it truly horrible. Imagine knowing every single conscious mind in the universe and being forced by your principles to cut that life in half. The soul stone isn’t really shown to have much power otherwise. Thanos was the only person with really the means and opportunity to really use the soul stone to get this effect. Banner didn’t really use any of the stones individually.

Comics ,False,"So I recently got back into comics and am trying to get up to date but there are a few things I am confused about and am hoping you guys can clarify. 

1. If Reed Richards recreated the multi verse at the end of secret wars, how come he couldn't recreate the ultimate universe? He made 616 among a bunch of others, so why does Miles go to 616 instead of getting his own universe back?

2. Also regarding Miles, why doesn't he remember the ultimate universe? When he was on battleworld he remembered everything but now it's like he's always been a part of 616. 

3. Just a general question about the ongoing books now. I thought all the main titles were now in the same universe, 616. So how is Iron Man hanging out with the avengers and Captain marvel in their books, but in his title he is the Iron God and he just murdered a bunch of people? Also, in Reckoning War, the moon got destroyed but no one else seems to notice in any other book. 

Are these all supposed to be separate universes or did Marvel just give up on editing. I find that pre secret wars, whenever there was a major event, it would affect everyone.

Comics ,False,"This post does contain spoilers for iron man #17 so if you’re currently reading that series and you haven’t read that issue then I suggest not reading this.

Anyways is anyone else tired of Tony’s constant mischaracterization? The problem with ongoing comic book characters is that they’re never allowed to actually progress. 

Tony has been stuck in a constant loop of screwing up and redeeming himself he’s constantly being done dirty and it gets repetitive after awhile, especially when a huge part of Tony’s character is that he’s a futurist and him constantly messing up big time kind of makes him a pretty bad futurist, I mean I don’t think anyone would trust a futurist that constantly makes decisions that blow up in his face all the time.

It seems that writers nowadays focus on villainizing Tony too much, and if they don’t villainize him they write him out to be a stereotypical rich douchebag which isn’t his character at all, and this current iron man run is no exception. The writer for the current iron man series seem to be pushing the notion that tony has a good complex which isn’t true. Now does Tony have an ego? Yes he does, but an ego and a god complex are 2 different things. Tony’s ego has always been an act to overcompensate for his insecurity. The only time Tony has ever had a god complex was during Superior Iron man where Tony’s personality was inverted by the red onslaught if Tony had a god complex originally then his personality would have never been inverted that way. Tony doesn’t actually believe he’s above everybody else and he definitely doesn’t believe he’s always right. 

The build up to Tony’s god complex wasn’t even done properly either earlier in the series tony nearly crippled himself breaking a giant vibranium/adamantium/iron sphere that a few doctors we’re trapped inside of. That’s not something someone with a god complex would do. And now currently in this series tony has been imbued with the power cosmic and is now the iron god, which sounds cool but instead of making an interesting and new story out of it Tony’s god complex is being pushed more than ever where tony ends up murdering an entire team of superheroes including his best friend Rhodey. The writer turned tony into a murderer for no reason now obviously they aren’t going to stay dead tony will obviously use his powers to bring them back to life and then he’s gonna have to redeem himself in an insane way AGAIN but this whole loop of tony acting like a straight up villain and then making up for it is getting old. It’s destroying his character and it’s starting to make him irredeemable. I’ve grown up reading iron man my whole life so it really makes me upset that this is what modern iron man comics are now. 

Ever since civil war character assassinated Tony things haven’t been the same, then afterwards the the mcu came along and now writers try to copy RDJ’s personality and charm onto comic tony but it ends up coming off as tony acting like an an asshole or it makes him look like a man child, then after fraction left a whole series of bad iron man runs followed which didn’t help at all. I just wanna go back to old tony where he was simply a good man with many flaws who wanted to move humanity towards the future and make the world a better place as both tony stark and iron man where at the end of the day you could definitely call him a hero despite his flaws, but nowadays you can actually debate that he’s an anti hero. I just want an iron man run where we go back to tony actually being a good human being without having to make up for some mistake that he made.",Marvel,Is anyone else tired of Tony stark’s mischaracterization?
Other,False,"I notice that speedsters (The Flash for example) mention that they need to eat a lot of food due to burning a lot of calories but surely calorie burn is based off of personal limits rather than a fixed statistic. If a professional bodybuilder is benching 10KG, he ain’t going to be burning calories or gaining muscle because of his own personal limits. So how is The Flash burning 100x the normal amount of calories running, if he is exerting the same amount of energy as a normal person running?",Marvel,Why do speedsters lose calories even if they don’t exhaust themselves?
Film/Television,False,"My top 5 Marvel Heroes are Captain America, Daredevil, Thor, Spider-Man and Dr. Strange.
Yeah, Spidey is very low for me in comparison to most of the fans.

Unpopular opinion here, NWH is very very good but it isn't the best Spider-Man movie, Spider-Man 2 is still the best and Into the Spider-verse is also at the top.
I've seen some people saying it's the best super hero film of all time, that it should have been nominated for best picture, that Tom Holland is the perfect Spider-Man now and all that. Fans are exagerating, some even say that SM NWH is the best MCU film (Winter Soldier, Endgame and Infinity War are still  the best) and others also say SM has the best MCU trilogy when in reality Far From Home is not very good and many disliked it and the first half of NWH is very meh. Cap still has the best MCU trilogy, the First Avenger is the weakest of the 3 but still very very entertaining and has a lot of heart.

Honestly, I'm not a big fan of Spidey. Apart from Doc Ock, Green Goblin, Mysterio and even Venom if you count him as a villain and not an anti hero; all the other villains are interchangeable goons that fly, punch hard or throw energy from their hands or something and with not much depth. I feel they need an ideology, a better personality and maybe even get to kill someone close to Peter to be more relevant.

For example in X-Men, Magneto has a great personality, ideology and powers.
He has also caused the death of many characters (in the Ultimate universe cause so much death in ultimatum), you can sympathize with him and understand why he does what he does.
Apocalypse is very powerful and has an ideology and even has his four horsemen, Stryker has done horrible things to mutants, Mr. Sinister too.

Daredevil has the Kingpin which almost always is causing Matt great trouble and Bullseye has killed or hurt some of Matt's girlfriends, and that skill of turning every object into a projectile is very entertaining and dangerous for DD to face.

I know people love Spectacular SM but the episodes without Green Goblin, Venom or Doc Ock were boring. Electro, Rhino, Sandman, Shocker and Hammerhead for example are boring and are just regular crooks with nothing interesting. 
Peter struggle with his responsibilities is interesting to see and very relatable but when they overuse the Parker Luck aspect with him it becomes kind of boring, predictable and repetitive.
Unpopular opinion I know, if someone can make me change my mind with those things about his villains or the Spectacular Spider-Man (which many say it's the perfect portrayal along with the PS4 version which is a greay story and a also a great game) I would really really appreciate it.",Marvel,Help me appreciate Spider-Man more
Film/Television,False,"Did ever think about what happened to those who got snapped during surgery or pregnancy or those who moved on and suddenly see their family come back.

The problem I’m having is that I have no idea where to start at all. There’s so many different stories that trying to find a starting point is very hard.

Film/Television,False,"I just watched Spider-Man last night and I have questions about the plot. My boyfriend is a super Spider-Man comic fan and I’ve tagged along for the MCU ride. My understanding of the storyline and multiverse logic is based on what I can remember from watching the MCU franchise (movies and the more recent TV shows). 

My questions and spoilers are included below.

Do the villains truly get their second chance to escape death? It appears that they were plucked from their respective universes right before being killed, and the respective Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?) were plucked at a later point in their timelines into Tom Holland’s Spiderverse, having already killed the villains and are therefore appearing older than when we last saw them in their movies.

So if the villains were put back into their timelines at the moment they were about to be killed, they could still be killed by their respective Spider-Men because those Spider-Men have NOT been plucked into Tom Holland’s Spiderverse yet and therefore could not have known that these villains were cured (except for the obvious physical transformations, which may give them pause). 

Also, would forgiving the villains create a split in the timeline if there are older versions of the Tobey and Andrew Spider-Men who’ve already killed their villains as well as younger versions of them who do not kill their villains? Or does changing the past catch up to them and alter their histories?",Marvel,Spider-Man: No Way Home plot questions [spoilers warning]
Comics ,False,It's been a while since I picked up any comics. These days I stick to collections like omnibus' or the paperback collections that have like 5 comics in one. I picked up Silver Surfer Black a while back and finally got to read it. It's really really good. I want to get more surfer stories at this level. Got any recommendations I can snag on amazon or something?,Marvel,Recommendations for Silver Surfer stories? (paperback/omnibus)
Comics ,False,Do the Marvel Knight books take place in the 616 ?,Marvel,Marvel Knights canon?
Other,False,"Hi fellow Marvel fans! I have a pretty far fetched theory about the MCU before multiverse of madness. So back in Loki, the Kang variant was talking about how he stopped the multiversal war right? How was this not shown before in any books that was held by those ancient libraries? Like the one shown in “What If?” where Strange tries to find spells to summon powerful beings. This got me thinking, what if the multiversal war never even happened? Well, not yet. It sounds far fetched, but what if the MCU goes through a continuous loop forever. This one ending up different, or just like all the others. And the multiversal war happens in Multiverse of Madness. It would make sense, all the other timelines colliding like shown in Far From Home. They all came for Peter Parker, but now they would be coming for control just like Kang said. Let me know what you think bc I’m still working on this theory.",Marvel,Multiverse Theory
Comics ,False,"A while back I remeber seeing a teaser of an upcoming coming series called All New All Different Savage Avengers. What really caught my eye was Hulkverine and Anti Venom. I don't know much about Anti Venom, however I am familiar with Hulkverine thanks to The Totally Aweosme Hulk. 

After reading an article explaining the team, it turns out that Electra is now the new Daredevil after a recent major event involving Kingpin and Luke Cage fighting to become mayor (which doesn't sound very interesting). Also, it turns out there is a new host for Anti Venom! While I didn't know anything about this guy before, the article mentioned that Donny Cates's Venom explains how it happened around issue 33. I plan to read Venom Volume 1 tonight so I guess I can start there. But is there anything else I should read?",Marvel,What Do You Think I Should Read Before Reading All New All Different Savage Avengers?

Comics ,False,"Sometimes the crossovers get intense or the menace of the week features more than one bad guy.  Inevitable betrayals, lack of ethics, and ego bruising means somewhere along the line one villain burned another and their rivalries can match their animosity towards the heroes.

Comics ,False,"I need help understanding the order of events in the Marvel universe between Devil's Reign and Reckoning War since both events are kinda being published simultaneously and both involve significant developments for Moon Knight.

I am caught up with what's going on with Moon Knight for Devil's Reign, especially as his ongoing series ties into the event. However, Reckoning War just threw a huge curveball in *Fantastic Four* \#40 revealing &gt;!how the destruction of Earth's moon affected Moon Knight.!&lt;

I have no idea whether the events of Reckoning War will be touched upon in Jed McKay's *Moon Knight* series, if at all, so my question for those who might have a better idea of how these things work is: does Reckoning War take place before or after Devil's Reign?",Marvel,[Question] Order of events: Devil's Reign and Reckoning War?

Comics ,False,"in ultimate marvel team up #9 peter visists the baxter building and sees this whole presentation about who the fantastic four are and how they got their powers, it was a very fun and meta comic.  Then, in USM #s 68 and 69, Johnny goes to Peter's high school, and while i was expecting the fantastic four to tell him beforehand and then have johnny be a mainstay in the highschool, they don't tell peter and it seems like he not only doesn't know who johnny is but he straight up doesn't know the fantastic four exist.  johnny tells him they're not ready to ""go public yet"" so im confused as to whether team up was even canon or what's going on.",Marvel,ultimate spider-man plot hole?
Film/Television,False,"Ok so Stark Industries is under investigation. But the focus is on the Head of Security and not the CEO? That’s weird. And why didn’t Pepper help Peter and May find a place to live so they didn’t have to be crammed in with Happy? And why does Happy have DUM-E and not Pepper? I guess she didn’t want that robot. So is Pepper’s absence mainly because Gwyneth Paltrow quit acting? I can’t imagine they’d get rid of Gwyneth because people dislike her. 

Pepper isn’t be of the more popular characters plus the director of Guardians of the Galaxy and the woman who plays the wasp are both controversial. I can’t imagine them refusing to hire Gwyneth again because she’s controversial. Pepper didn’t even need to be in the movie. She could’ve just have been mentioned in the news and Happy could’ve mentioned her.",Marvel,Why was Pepper Potts not even mentioned in No Way Home?
Comics ,False,"I'm fairly new to marvel, as I first started watching the movies 5 years ago and reading the comics a couple months ago.

When I started the Uncanny X-Men ([this one](https://images.app.goo.gl/YKuhzSDYiJSTp37M9)) even though I could imagine what happened with knowledge from movies, there are still a lot of gaps.

Comics ,False,"From what I understand, Vance Astro originally comes from an alternate timeline where he gets sent to space, and wakes up on alien world thousands of years later. He meets Yondu, forms the Guardians of the Galaxy, and because of time travel interacts with 616 characters from time to time. Somewhere along the way he grabs his timeline’s version of Captain America’s shield, and gets sent back in time to the 616 universe. He goes a little insane, and meets Peter Quill and his team, and inspires them to become the new Guardians of the Galaxy. 

Is there like a reading order to read through all those events, or is it something you have to dig and piece together the right comics to get that overall story?",Marvel,Vance Astro comics
Film/Television,False,"Hear me out. 

In spiderman into the spiderverse, the OG peter parker. Aka the one who dies, is tom hollands spidey. 

Context:
In spiderman homecoming, there is a scene where peter (tom) interrogates the dude present at the crime scene for the first time. 
Aaron davis. Aka. The prowler. 

He has a nephew staying in brooklyn. Aka miles morales. 

It is said so. 

With the introduction of kingpin in hawkeye, it is safe to say that he is here to stay. 

Marvel is currently experimenting with the multiverse, a series of events present during the timeline of both tom hollands peter parker as well as kingpin. 

Thru some miracle down the line the multiverse gets fixed.

Which brings us to the setting of spiderman into the spiderverse. 
Where: 
1) kingpin is trying to open the multiverse again. 
2) spiderman is trying to stop it from happening. Because he has experienced it enough for one lifetime as well as hes aware of the consequences. 

In short: what if spiderman into the spiderverse is dorectly linked in the future of our tom hollands spiderman..? 

What r ur thoughts on this.",Marvel,What if

Film/Television,False,"Literally I can’t understand how the TVA work in Loki. So, if Loki was sent there as he wasn’t meant to escape but the Avengers weren’t sent there as they were supposed to go back in time? Does that mean people like Dormmamu or Thanos didn’t get sent there as they were supposed to attack Earth, or what if Strange didn’t turn into Doctor Strange. Would he be sent there as he was meant to be doctor strange???",Marvel,Am I just stupid?
Film/Television,False,Bottom right.,Marvel,Spotted Defender Strange in the trailer
Film/Television,False,"This can be about any comic book movie (Marvel or DC) but I’m curious to see which ones have evoked an emotional response! 

For me there are quite a few lol. I’ll start off by saying that I have not watched the older Spider-Man movies in such a long time so this can definitely change! Also, no DC movie has ever made me cry, although Joker left me disturbed in a good way! 

X-Men: Days of Future Past, Avengers Endgame, and Spider-Man: No Way Home have all made me tear up from pure joy. The ending of DoFP when Wolverine looks over at Professor X and sees everyone alive and happy again was such an awesome scene! For Endgame it’s obviously the Portals scene &amp; Spider-Man: NWH I pretty much felt that way from the moment Andrew &amp; Toby shows up lol, but especially when Andrew gets to save MJ. Such an awesome scene! 

Big Hero 6, Logan, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 &amp; Vol. 2, WandaVision, and Avengers: Endgame have all made me tear up/cry from sadness. Baymax sacrificing himself was such a gut punch the first time I watched the movie, although on subsequent viewings it’s doesn’t elicit the same response. That’s not a knock on the film, I just know what’s to come afterwards. GotG Vol. 1 makes me tear up every time Groot says “We are Groot” and sacrifices himself. GotG Vol. 2 makes me cry every single time Cat Stevens starts playing during Yondu’s funeral. Such a powerful scene. Basically if Rocket is crying, I’m crying lol. The WandaVision finale makes me cry from the moment Wanda says goodbye to her children all the way through to when she says goodbye to Vision. Logan &amp; Endgame make me sob like a small child EVERY. DAMN. TIME. Wolverine &amp; Iron Man die, especially Logan since Wolverine is my favorite superhero. 

I should also mention that Deadpool 2 makes me tear up but I’m conflicted on whether it’s due to joy or sadness, which is a testament to how awesome the movie (theatrical version) is! It’s when the unplugged version of A-Ha’s ‘Take On Me’ starts playing is when I start to get emotional. Seeing Wade finally happy reuniting with Vanessa is such a happy moment, but there’s the somber feeling of them sill being dead. Again, the music helps elevate it a lot. 

How about you guys?",Marvel,Which Comic Book movies have made you cry?
Film/Television,False,"I like Deadpool as much as the next guy, but under no circumstance should he be in the movie.

Marvel released two trailers already for “Multiverse of Madness” and they had one thing in common - there wasn’t a single joke in them. Now, I’m not saying there won’t be any jokes, but it definately looks like Marvel is doing a more serious movie with this one. Deadpool is not that. Deadpool is everything but serious.

Call this a stupid rant, or that I’m annoyed at a simple rumor, downvote this if you really want - but I just, for the life of me, don’t get why some people want Deadpool in this movie. Not everything has to be filled with jokes and comedy, you can have a more serious movie (which MoM is looking to be).

Sorry for the rant, my friends just annoyed the living shit out of me lol.",Marvel,"“Multiverse of Madness” has an absurd amount of rumors, but one I absolutely cannot agree with is Deadpool. He should absolutley NOT be in that movie."
Film/Television,False,"My guess is that variants are just other versions of time and that the timelines were always meant to be controlled into one timeline, and that multiverse counterparts are just different versions like Andrew garfield and tom holland. I haven't seen wandavision and I dont remember most of the shows/movie's facts about the multiverse and variants, but are variants and multiversal counterparts different things? Im thinking no but i just wanna make sure..",Marvel,Are multiversal counterparts and variants the same thing?

Film/Television,False,I’ve recently started rewatching the ultimate Spider-Man Series and noticed that dislike each other. Do they have a fight against each other or do the comics have an explanation?,Marvel,Can Spider-Man defeat Nova?
Film/Television,False,"Just like Spiderman: No Way Home the Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness trailer blew the internet away. Also like the NWH (I'm just gonna call it NWH from now on cuz No Way Home takes too long to type or maybe I'm just lazy idk), the MOM (I'm just gonna call it MOM from now on cuz Multiverse of Madness takes even longer to type or maybe I'm just lazy idk) trailer had a moment in which fans got a spike of adrenaline. Just like how fans were blown away with Dr. Octopus' famous ""Hello Peter"" fans were also blown away when a mysterious yet familiar voice saying ""Should we tell him the truth."" Once this line was said everyone immediately started speculating on who the mystery belonged to. And while surfing through the internet I found that most people said that it was the voice of Patrick Stewart's Professor X. However, I'm gonna go in a completely different direction and say that it was Ian McKellen's Magneto who said the famous ""Should we tell him the truth"" line. **Also before we begin there will be spoilers for X2: X men United and X men: The Last stand.**

The first reason why I think it was McKellen's Magneto is because it sounded more like him. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen sound really similar but if you listen closely it sounds more like McKellen's Magneto than it does Stewart's Professor X.

The second reason why I think it was Magneto who said ""Should we tell him the truth."" is because it is more of a Magneto thing to say. You see Charles' philosophy is that he will hide the truth from you to protect you whereas Erik will tell you the truth because he thinks you have a right to know. An example of this is in X men: The Last Stand with Jean Grey and the Phoenix. You see, in that movie Professor X hid the Phoenix from Jean and locked it away in her own mind as opposed to Magneto who told her to embrace the Phoenix and be what she truly is. He also had no intention of controlling her either. Now I know technically Magneto never told Jean the truth but still if he took care of Jean instead of Charles I think he would've told her. Another example of Magneto's philosophy in action in X2. In this movie the two have a conversation on Logan. Erik asks Charles why doesn't he just give Logan his memories and move on wo which Charles responds by saying the mind is fragile and he should take it in piece by piece. Like Grey if Erik was in Charles' position then I think he would've just given Logan's memory at once and moved on.

Now whether it was Erik or Charles speaking I think that they both were in that scene together. After all, who else would Erik have these philosophical conversations with or vice versa. So both Professor X and Magneto fans win.

I think we all know the next huge villain will be the celestial related. Maybe the Celestial Destructor, which means (obviously) another huge merge of superheroes like the X-Men, the Eternals, Fantastic Four, and what's left of the avengers amongst other characters in an end-game type battle.

Film/Television,False,"Hi Everyone! (possible spoilers below)

Ever get confused in what order you should watch the Marvel Cinematic Universe movies?  Perhaps you are just new to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and are looking for some guidance on how you should aproach that large number of movies and series that have come out recently. Then maybe my chart attached to this post can offer you some assistance with this. If you want info on how to read this chart, then please refer to the blueprint I pasted on the left side of the image.

Please note that this is not in any way the one and only sequence you can use to watch the MCU. This is in my opinion the best way to understand all the references throughout the movies and to understand the overall story.

This method is also designed to be used in a very flexible matter because this design allows you to follow any timeline of your liking at any time, or even gives you the choice to follow multiple timelines simultaneously.

At the same time it uses a system that withholds you from watching a movie unless you have seen the necessary movies beforehand. This is done by the 'lock' system as explained on the blueprint.

This chart is under constant improvement, meaning I am planning on adding Netflix shows like Daredevil or Punisher on the chart as well in the near future or make some other small adjustments. Aditionally I will keep updating it as long as new content from the MCU is released. (Looking forward on making this chart a huge mess once Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is released).

Because it is under constant improvement, feel free to leave any suggestions behind! Would love to know what you think. :)

If you require a custom design like a lighter background, a higher resolution version or something like that, you can let me know as well.

Kind regards,

IMO it’s a bit strange (don’t fucking say it.) that this is doctor strangers second film. It really feels like they’re setting up a trilogy ender here. I kinda would’ve preferred a Doctor strange plot around the title of sorcerer supreme (cause it really has no fucking meaning in the mcu.) mordo and another one of his usual villains. 

Though I see why they’re doing this, it’s a really convenient way of them to add mutants (if that is their goal.) because at this stage adding them naturally while keeping their fundamental characters and themes intact would be hard. 

Also it’s weird we’re getting two massive event movies within 6 months of each other. But again convient for marvel. 

I believe this film will be good as films go. But a multiversal clusterfuck with a sorcerer supreme strange being the main defender of HIS reality to protect as sorcerer supreme (that he fought to be.) would’ve been sick as a trilogy ender.

In Endgame, Tony asked Dr. Strange: Hey, you said one out of fourteen million, we'd win, yeah? Tell me this is it. 
And Doctor Strange replied : If I tell you what happens, it won't happen.

I initially thought it’s one of movie cliche about changing the future that we have seem so often, so that’s why that’s Dr. Strage didn’t want to tell Tony more.

Now, in Avwnger, there was a scene which Tony and Steve argues.

Steve Rogers said to Tony: I know guys with none of that worth ten of you. I've seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself. You're not the guy to make the sacrifice play, to lay down on a wire and let the other guy crawl over you.”
And Tony Stark sparkly replied: I think I would just cut the wire.

Now, is his related to why Dr. strange won’t tell Tony, not because of some future changing issue, but because the only way to beat Thanos is with Tony’s sacrifice.

Other,False,"In Loki, He Who Remains said there was a multiversal war.  Time lines and universes destroying each other, and it nearly destroyed existence.  To me, this mutiversal war, was Secret Wars 2015, for some it will click and make a little bit of sense, but to the others that don’t know the ins and outs of that story, let me give you a bit of what happened, and feel free to comment for, or against, or come up with your own theories.

In Secret Wars, we find out that every universe in the Marvel continuity is on a crash course with one another, and the only way to stop every world from being destroyed, is for one Earth (which pretty much represents one universe) to destroy the next Earth in its path, if neither are destroyed, then both are.  So basically every Earth/Universe has to run the gauntlet (wrestling fans will be sure to get that reference) and be the last surviving universe.  These battles are known as the Incursions, and they are being orchestrated by the Beyonders.  

These Beyonders are multiversal beings of such immense power, that they easily kill the Living Tribunal (essentially a being imbued with the power of God, who is tasked maintaining balance in its universe…there’s one in each universe).  For those wondering how powerful the Living Tribunal is, it can literally shut off the Infinity Stones with a thought.

After an untold time, and after an unknown number of universes were wiped out, Dr Doom, Dr Strange and the Molecule Man, Owen Reece, eventually figure out a way to take away the powers of the Beyonders and bestow their power unto Dr Doom.  Doom takes what little remains of each universe, and creates Battleworld…and it’s ruled and overseen by, formerly Doctor, God King Doom.

I’m not going to tell the entire story, everyone can look it up if they’d like, but in the end these powers are stripped from Doom and given to Reed Richards.  Reed uses this power to reset all the Beyonders have done.  The story arc ends with Reed teaching his son Franklin how to create universes as well, and they depart to an unknown destination (at the time) to create and maintain new universes.

What I’ve just explained, could be told from another point of view, He Who Remains’ POV, they do sound similar.  Now people will say “How does Franklin and Reed Richards lead to He Who Remains?”  Well most Marvel fans know that He Who Remains is in fact a version of Kang the Conqueror.  And Kang’s real name is…Nathaniel Richards.  Kang is thought to be a descendant of Reed Richards (for a while Kang himself thought he was a descendant of Doom, but it was later discovered he wasn’t).

Kang can travel through time, anyone that’s seen Loki knows the TVA has that technology, it can be assumed they got it from Kang.  Being a descendant of the smartest man of his time (Reed Richards), and related in some way to Franklin (who can literally do whatever the fuck he wants.  He could turn a booger into a planet with sustainable life, he can take the Living Tribunal and make it into a urinal cake if he wanted), Kang has the potential for unrivaled intelligence and unfathomable power.  Now that doesn’t mean he DOES have all that, but a fraction of each seems reasonable.  

Kang is from the 31st century.  Now with an epic change in the multiversal landscape like the Incursions, whose to say it didn’t take a thousand years for someone to organize all the chaos that came from it.  Whose to say that Kang didn’t use his time travel tech, along with his genetic potential to be smarter then everyone and add to that the possibility that of his latent power that no one can touch, and come back in time, to take the chaos that became the multiverse and mold it to his liking.  He wouldn’t need to be the most powerful, or the smartest, but have access to enough of both (which he does) to make all this happen.  Remember, the Living Tribunal, the being responsible for maintaining balance in the universe was gone for a time, someone with the know how could have taken his place for a time.  And He Who Remains had the potential to sit on that throne.

Just a thought…a very complex thought, but once I got the idea, the other dots started to line up.  I’m sure a number of my fellow Redditors who are more knowledgeable in Marvel can, and probably will shoot this down, but I at least thought it was intriguing.",Marvel,"So I’ve got a bit of a theory that came to me last night. I’m sure loads of people will disagree, and this being Reddit, I’ll be told some very graphic and personal insults…"
Film/Television,False,I've never seen any of the X-Men movies and I want to understand a little bit more about the characters. Also I'm too lazy to watch all 13 movies.,Marvel,Which X-Men movies should I watch in preparation for Multiverse of Madness
Film/Television,False,"So I'm sure Infinity War has a billion loopholes or ways Thanos wouldn't obtain all the stones or whatever.
But I was thinking, could they have not just used a Pym Particle on Vision? I mean it's not like Vision is going to get fatigued in the same way Ant-Man did when he went giant. If it was giant Vision, how would Thanos get the stone from his head? And even if he managed to get the stone from his head, the stone wouldn't even fit in the gauntlet.
And if it being too big is an issue, make him small. Thanos wouldn't even be able to find the stone. Just make Vision small and put him in one of those unbreakable lock things that Dr.Strange can do.

Idk, like I said there are a lot of ways to just totally avoid Thanos winning there, but I've never heard someone suggest this idea.
Pym Particles are busted strong.

Also yeah I know Ant-Man wasn't in Infinity War but it's not like they didn't have his number on hand back from Civil War, they knew he was out there along with this technology.",Marvel,Please tell me if this idea would've been a loophole for Infinity War.
Film/Television,False,Anyone else have anything they want to see or match ups,Marvel,When can I get a good dark Ghost rider movie or Wolverine vs OmegaRed
Film/Television,False,"Its pretty common knowledge that the main Marvel comics universe is Earth-616. This is simple, easy, and rolls off the tongue well.

However, the equivalent for the cinematic side of Marvel is the mouthful of Earth-19999. Fox's X-Men is Earth-10005, and the 1970s Incredible Hulk is Earth-400005. None of these names have quite the same ring as ""Earth-616""

Fan Made,False,"I have always like seeing youtube videos where they pin marvel characters against each other that we dont normally get to see in the movies but I always hated the quality.

Film/Television,False,"*NWH spoilers*

The Tobey and Andrew reveal in NWH was fucking incredible. But I think it would have hit completely different if there weren't leaks everywhere online for like a year before the movie even released. Like how it was intended. It seems a lot of people are in agreement about that. 

*potential MOM spoilers*

But now, with MOM around the corner it seems like the same mistakes are being made, with interviewers trying to force Ryan Reynolds to confirm or deny his involvement in MOM. Like, it's 2 months away. Wait for the movie. Be surprised.

I don't care if people leak major plot points for themselves, but when there's actual articles about it online and not just on spoiler subreddits or threads, it completely ruins what could be great surprises for other people.",Marvel,I don't get how obsessed everyone is with ruining major surprises for upcoming MCU projects

Comics ,False,"This is really surprisingly good on so many levels. It’s not only great story and art, the creative team seems to make a clear homage to Frank Miller and Klaus Johnson’s work on Daredevil years ago. The comic teases that its story continues in the new Captain America #0, and so I’m really stoked. I can’t remember the last time I read an event-supporting comic that wasn’t a disappointment. Really looking forward to what’s coming. I would say even if you aren’t signing on to Zdarsky’s Devil’s Reign, pick up this issue.

But what is confusing me, whether he is in Andrew Garfield’s universe or Tobey Maguire’s.
In the trailer there is a painting on a wall that appears to be Raimi’s spiderman, but the trailer also contains scene with same OSCORP logo from TASM franchise. Also in the Maguire’s universe Venom is already dead, so I believe that saying  “I am Venom” refers to Hardy’s universe.

The Hulk has gone on numerous rampages yet there’s never been a government campaign to round up every person with radiation based powers regardless of their guilt or innocence.

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit

I find myself in fairly successful phase of my life, however my mind is very busy with work/family matters and the usual kind of books I read (to give you and idea now I’m reading Ray Dalio’s “Principles for dealing with the changing world order”) just add to that stress/constant spinning of the brain, so I’m looking for a nice way to wind down, relax, and do something I enjoy

I’ve never been into comics/graphic novels before, however, my favourite TV show is Big Bang Theory and while watching an episode the other day for the 3,000th time, I’ve started wondering whether I would like that.

I’m also a bit nuts for Batman (mostly from the animated TV series when younger and later on the Dark Knight trilogy) and Iron Man (MCU), so probably that would be a good starting point.

The questions I have for you are 2:

1 - What’s the best starting point? I usually don’t like starting something from the middle so my first idea was to literally start from the very beginning however I’m conscious that’s from decades ago and I’m not sure how ‘available’ older runs are

2 - I like to do all my readings/relax time things on my M1 iPad Pro 11”: what’s the best app for reading comics/graphic novels?

The time force would catch spidey as soon as it happened (like with loki) unless they just didn't care/ some bs happened. All the villains are just nostalgia bait that again is not cared for.

Whilst this is *undeniably* a huge, coordinated effort between hundreds (if not thousands) of people ranging from the A-Listers that we see on screen to the IT departments that manage various VFX houses, we would almost definitely not have the Cinematic Universe that we have today if it were not for the guiding force of Kevin Feige.  From the little I've seen of him in interviews, he doesn't seem like the man that does any of this for the praise or recognition - however - I think it's worth acknowledging the immense amount of effort he's put into ensuring our (and his) favourite characters are ***carefully and faithfully*** translated to the screen in a way that appeases both long-time fans whilst simultaneously bringing in new audiences.

Marvel does this frequently with trailers as to not spoil some surprises .I did however find some visual evidence that someone/something is edited out of the trailer, but I do not know who or what is edited out.So let's dive in.

In the trailer you see Doctor Strange walk into a room with 7 chairs. In one of those chairs it's obvious that Marvel does not want to show us who/what is sitting in the chair.You can see the mask (used to cover up) flowing and wobbling around, just by the left shoulder of Doctor Strange.

Also, any *other* characters' solo comics, mini-series, etc. I should read because they surprisingly have a LOT to do with X-Men?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Below is a list that might help show *how* comprehensive my read-throughs of the X-Men (up to the 90s so far) and Scarlet Witch/Vision stories (up to mid-00s so far) have been which may narrow things down. For instance, if I said ""it's a comprehensive reading of all of X-Men,"" then it may be easy to say, ""then yeah, read the entire \_\_\_\_\_ run of Deadpool/whoever"" but when you see the various skips/gaps, maybe that becomes ""oh, okay, you're not reading absolutely *everything* but are covering a bunch of bases, so hm... just read these 4 major stories.""

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**X-Men &amp; Related**

* **Original X-Men Run**:
   * **X-Men**: #1, 4, 12-16, 49-66 -- O5, Magneto &amp; the Brotherhood (incl. Mastermind), Juggernaut, Sentinels, Havok, and Polaris
      * Also read Hank's transformation into his blue furred form
* **Claremont Era**:
   * **Uncanny X-Men**: I can basically count on one hand the number of Claremont-written UXM issues I didn't read -- every single major event, crossover story, character introduction/arc, and almost everything in between.
   * **New Mutants**: Up to the end of ""Inferno""; then the last little stretch introducing Cable &amp; Deadpool -- formation of X-Force.
   * **X-Factor**: Up to the end of ""Fall of the Mutants""; then Claremont's Apocalypse/Askani story and the formation of the government team
   * **Excalibur**: Up to the end of ""Cross-Time Caper""; then various issues of Davis' run (skipped a few more issues here &amp; there compared to UXM/NM though)
      * Also read/skimmed some of the early Captain Britain stories in preparation for his and Betsy's future integration into the X-Men family
   * I also initially skipped the Longshot miniseries but went back and read it half-way through the ""Shattershot"" Annuals crossover... and meh, I don't think I missed too much having skipped it since I didn't really love it.
* **90s So Far**:
   * **UXM &amp; XMv2**: So far I've read up to XMv2 #19 and UXM #297 meaning I'm just slightly past X-Cutioners Song.
   * **Wolverine**: Read Weapon X plus a handful of Wolverine's ongoing -- #51-65 since it included some important status quo altering moments involving Wolverine's relationships &amp; touched more on Team X's past
   * **X-Force**: Not counting crossover issues, I've mostly only skimmed this series up #15 to keep tabs on Cable, Cannonball, &amp; Sunspot. Couldn't stand the art until Capullo, don't really care about most of the characters and the writing has only been whatever. Only exceptions are #8, which I read because it gave background to Cable and had Mignola's excellent art, and #15 which was decent fun.
      * Any non-crossover story arcs during this period I should add as the occasional check-in?
   * **X-Factor**: Not counting crossover issues, I've only read two pre-""X-Cutioner"" issues involving Stryfe &amp; Mr. Sinister. I find it really funny, and arguably has the most 'modern' sounding banter/writing, but kinda like X-Factor with the O5 following ""Fall of the Mutants"" -- it's mostly seemed fairly inconsequential. I love Alex, Lorna, Rahne, etc., but I haven't felt compelled to read every issue.
      * Any non-crossover story arcs during this period I should add as the occasional check-in?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Deadpool**

With Deadpool, as you can see I've so far seen his introduction and his brief return in X-Force #15. I enjoy Deadpool's films and have a decent understanding of his character. I know early on, he wasn't the 4th Wall breaking character he's become. I also see a general consensus  that Joe Kelly's run is one of the best runs, but that's in the later 90s, and I think Gail Simone's run is also pretty highly regarded as well?

All that's later and I imagine most of it hardly connects to the X-universe frequently or in any major ways. So in lieu of necessarily reading those *entire* runs, any particular story arcs in either run to incorporate into my overall X-Men reading?

Or, for simplicity's sake since I already have a decent understanding of the character and his origins, should I streamline and just save Deadpool for some future Deadpool-centric marathon and only read him during crossover events or as part of Uncanny X-Force?

This list is being used by me and another person who isn't the biggest fan of Deadpool -- they enjoyed his films but have zero interest in necessarily delving into his comics.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Scarlet Witch**

Prior to this X-Men-a-thon, I actually read a bunch of Scarlet Witch/Vision-centric stories in anticipation of WandaVision. As a result of those plus their MCU iterations, I ended up becoming really fond of those two plus others associated with them like Wonder Man, Wiccan, Speed, etc.

When it comes to *them*, I've read:

* Obviously Wanda's earliest appearances in X-Men
* **Avengers**: Some of the early flirtations between Vision and Wanda plus their wedding; Yesterday Quest
* **Vision and the Scarlet Witch #1-4**
* **Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol 2 #1-12**
* **Avengers West Coast #42-62**: ""Vision Quest"" and ""Darker Than Scarlet""; then read the final issue of West Coast where they're reformed into Force Works
* **Force Works**: Just the first issue 'cause of Wonder Man; is there *anything* else in here that's essential to her story? It just seemed like all of the edgy 90s cliches wrapped into one without any of the charm to me?
* **Vision Vol 1 (1994)**: Not essential and super-90s but it was fun!
* **Avengers Vol 3 (1998)**: Read #1-4; skimmed #5-9; Read #10-11; then pretty much skimmed or outright skipped everything beyond up to #73. I know there are some big Avengers storylines involving the likes of Ultron and Kang that I skipped that I may go back and read now. I was rushed last time haha
* **Avengers Disassembled**
* **Young Avengers**: #1-6; will definitely pick this back up. The first arc was a breeze to get through (modern comics in general read a lot faster)
* **House of M**: I'll probably *re*\-read this given how important it is for the X-Men as well as Wanda; this time I miiiiight read the X-centric tie-ins? At least the ones people seem to have liked.

For what to read I have the following -- anything else I should add? Where would I read about Wanda, Vision, and the twins beyond these? I know Wanda's got some sorta presence in the current Hickman or post-Hickman era but anything between? AvX? Idk how much presence Wanda has post-HoM.

But the last couple of years I've really just binged all the movies on Disney+ multiple times, even the side series like Loki and WandaVision as well. One thing I like in them is finding little things I missed each time I rewatch them, an example being Detective Wu doing card magic to show the officers his ID card, which is a hint to when he asked Scott about learning magic in Antman and the Wasp.

Comics ,False,"With the Moon Knight series coming up I decided to read up on the character and generally do a bit of background research. 

As a preface to what I want to talk about with regards to the comic mentioned in the title, I knew the basics about the character already and in doing more research found that in 1985 he was rewritten to have a greater emphasis on the multiple personalities through having it be a disorder. 

On page 4 of the comic Steven Grant and Marlene (his love interest) are having a conversation about a communique sent to Marc Spector. Steven replies that it is for Marc, not him (Steven). 
Marlene gets irate and snaps back 

**""... I hope you are joking -- because if you really think of yourself as two or three or four separate people --""**
 
To which Steven replies

**""I just forget once in a while, Marlene -- it's a problem, yes, but I'm able to control it...""** 

This struck me as quite interesting because in earlier comics Steven is fairly strict about telling those close to him when he plans to assume another identity. This interaction strikes me as a hint that even early in the characters solo runs that his multiple identities were more than just a convenient information gathering tool. That there could have been something else driving his need for multiple identities; which the 1985 change would clarify. 

I don't think it's a particularly big deal overall. Just thought it was an interesting interaction.",Marvel,"Moon Knight: White Angels (April, 1981)"

Film/Television,False,"
Only proceed if you’ve read them. 

First off, I do believe this film will probably be good in terms of how films go on their own. 

But a lot of the plot sounds like just flat out terrible decision making. 

First of this is doctor stranges second film, with the amount going on it’s very concerning whether he’s actually going to have any development as a character. Yes Cap 3 was basically an avengers film as well, but he has two solo movies before that. 

This feels like a trilogy ender that’s awkwardly being squeezed in because marvel can’t wait for another massive event movie. 

There’s so much potential to be explored with doctor strange villains, so the fact we’re getting Wanda as the big bad over any of the real choices is disappointing.  Like why is Mordo dead in the first 5 minutes? Plot wise they obviously want to skate over the post credit scene, but why not just have this mordo join the Illuminati instead of a varient? 

It ads more depth to the character, you could say he joined in order to take down strange and he was the one that orchestrated his arrest. That’s way more interesting than “random varient lol.” 

Then we get to Wanda. I’m not hard opposed to villain Wanda like some people are, least not the idea of it. 

The problem comes from the fact her character moving on is due at this point. Mean her arc since AOU has basically been “I love, I grieve, I fuck up, I’m really sorry won’t happen again.” 

And that’s not a complaint, WV was a great ending to that long arc and should’ve been the beginning of a new one. But we’re back with a grieving Wanda this time ready to commit genocide for her kids.

Despite his hatred towards Spider-Man, he may somehow have an obsession with setting him up (if you don't get what I mean), and would do his best to get Spider-Man into trouble and may do his best to get rid of him.

Plus it kind of makes possible adaptations of the Mar-Vell children like Phyla-Vell and Hulkling kinda tricky. Especially in Hulkling's case, ignoring the movie taking place in the 90's there's no indication MCU Mar-Vell is a big deal among the Kree when Mar-Vell's massive reputation in the galaxy is the primary reason why the Kree care so much about Hulkling, because their greatest warrior produced a child with Skrull royalty and they want to control him.

Comics ,False,"Just getting back into the hobby after years of being away and I am so torn if I should start collecting TPB's or single issues of the comics I want to read. I have never collected comics for money or value or with intent to profit from it, I buy to read and to treasure the stories and characters.

I love single issues because I love the thrill of the hunt. I love cataloging and finding special first appearance issues or death issues or milestone issues for my favorite characters. collecting single issues for me is like finding relics from the past and owning something from that time period.

But on the other hand I love trades because they look so good in my home library on the bookshelf and I love that everything is collected into a single volume for easy reading, plus I like some of the extras that come along with them. It's just so….convinent.

Was he a delinquent who saw his father murdered in a bar by a friend (Nicieza, Cable &amp; Deadpool)? 

An unstable grunt who tried to commit suicide and was recruited by special forces (Daniel Way)? 

Was he a free-range test subject after washing out of weapon X, with many of his memories altered, and he actually killed his living parents in an arson attack (Posehn/Duggan)?

Batman vs superman : how the fuck are we supposed to know that robin died, there is no dialogue, atleast robins funeral or Robin's statue with his name &amp; epitaph in centre of attention for 5 seconds. All criminals were dying with bat brand but batman refused to investigate &amp; got tricked by lex luthor that superman is a criminal for fuck sake, terrorists were killed using bullets made by lex luthor company.(worlds greatest detective bullshit)

Look at DC villains zod (laser eyes &amp; superstrenth),Doomsday(laser eyes &amp; superstrenth) and Darkseid (superstrenth &amp; laser eyes),stepenwolf (superstrenth)

How are we supposed to fear Darkseid when he was already defeated, ran home being injured and was so scared to come to earth because superman was here.

It’s kind of funny though because I think the Avengers have to be the only team in comic books that actively go at each other’s throats every day.

I noticed that barely any versions of spiderman has the power to shoot webs from their arms and just have it come from a mechanical web dispenser. Spiderman's most recognizable ability is to shoot webs but if that isn't part of his powers then are his only powers being able to climb walls and sense danger? Because if so, then it sounds like he doesn't even need powers to be spiderman since the climbing walls could also be replicated with a high tech suit.

Games,False,"WHAT IF, Marvel and Capcom collaborated again on, not another Marvel vs. Capcom video game per se (I mean, I don't know if they will after Infinite's failure or whatever), but a Marvel vs. Capcom COMICS, that's set either after MVC: Infinite, or set between games, and expands more on the world of **Earth-30847**, and all of that?

Ya know? Like, we see Marvel and Capcom characters interact more, fight each other, or even team up to fight someone else, and maybe find out where was the X-Men during the events of Infinite in this universe, or what happened to Mega Man, Roll, Rush, or Beat since MvC 2, and how did Tronn Bonn, Zero or X show up in the present timeline when they're suppose to be in the future, etc. etc.

Or hell, maybe explain how Spider-Man is apparently alive in Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite, after he was killed by Morlun of the Inheritors from **Earth-001** in ***Spider-Verse*** \#2 (2015)...?

The reason I ask this is because I realize that, even though the main appeal of the Marvel vs. Capcom franchise is that its genre is fighting game, it IS another universe that's canonically part of the wider Marvel multiverse (alongside **Earth-616**, **Earth-1610**, **Earth-199999** \[MCU\], etc.), so logically, it's gotta have some lore to it, doesn't it? I mean, from what I've read on Marvel Wiki (though, I don't know the main source of that info), the universe itself, **Earth-30847** technically debut with ***The Punisher*** video game by Capcom from 1993, and other Marvel games by Capcom are also part of this universe as well, so the MvC universe wasn't ALWAYS a series of fighting game between Marvel and Capcom characters that its known for, really.

But hey, what d'ya guys think? A Marvel vs. Capcom comic series? Would this be a good idea, or not? Would you read it, and d'ya think the lore of **Earth-30847** deserve to be explored a little more beyond what we saw (or played with) in the games? Any reasons why on either?

Steve: You're awful Ross

Comics ,False,"Hi, 

I'm looking for a nice point in the storyline where I can start reading Marvel comics. As I need to start somewhere, I figured starting around the start of the Thanos storyline would be a good point. Now, there's so much material to read and purchase I'm a bit lost on what would be the best way to go about this. 

Here me out.. I believe that the correct chronological order, bundle-wise is  Avengers vs Thanos -&gt; The silver surfer: rebirth of Thanos -&gt; Infinity Gauntlet -&gt; The silver surfer: The infinity gauntlet -&gt; The infinity gauntlet aftermath -&gt; The infinity war -&gt; The infinity war aftermath -&gt; the infinity crusade vol 1 -&gt; the infinity crusade vol 2. 

I also know that there are several omnibusses, for example the Infinity Gauntlet omnibus, the infinity war omnibus etc. 

I'm having difficulty understanding what is covered in what omnibus, and which ones I need to buy for the most coverage of content. 

Currently I'm thinking to buy the Avengers vs Thanos bundle, and after that straight into the Infinity gauntlet omnibus. However, what should I buy next? I already saw that the aftermath is not covered in the omnibus. Do I need to buy that separately, or is that covered in some other Omnibus?

I do hold some kind of resentment to steve for leaving bucky but through the whole movies steve did everything for everyone and didn’t let himself be happy and so i think we all should be happy that steve saved bucky in the first place and was there when he was free from hydra when he went to wakanda",Marvel,steve and peggy

Comics ,False,I'm re-reading Uncanny Avengers: Counter Evolutionary as it's one I quite like and I love the Counter Earth stuff. When was this created and has it featured in many stories/arcs etc?,Marvel,Are there any good stories set on Counter Earth with High Evolutionary?
Comics ,False,"There's quite a lot of comics I want to read, some newer but most are older, and I really want to try and stay up to date (my current knowledge is up to 2015), but I have neither the time but the money to go hunting for said comics.

 I've been reading reviews, and there's a lot of negative reviews, some ""okay"" reviews, and a few good reviews, so I don't know if I'm to make heads or tails. Is it worth downloading and subscribing?",Marvel,Should I get Marvel Unlimited?
Film/Television,False,"i am talking mainly about the mcu stones 

so how powerful do you think they would be if they combined and gained  sentience becoming an entity of it's own with its own mind and emotions 

what powers do you think it would have and do you think it would be good or evil",Marvel,what if the infinity stones combined?
Comics ,False,"I don’t think any other character has been on so many major teams. Captain America was on two.  Dr. Strange has now been two. For a supposedly arrogant, human-mistrusting speciesist, Namor sure is a team player.",Marvel,"Namor the Sub-Mariner has been an Avenger, Defender, Invader, and X-Man."
Comics ,False,"Comic characters have three creators: the writer of his/her first appearance, the inker of his/her first appearance, and the penciller of his/her first appearance.

Wolverine's first appearance was inked by Jack Abel, and pencilled by Herb Trimpe.

Roy Thomas and/or John Romita didn't write, ink or pencil Wolverine's first appearance. Meaning, they did NOT create Wolverine.

It pisses me off that Thomas and Romita get all the royalty money that should go to Trimpe's estate and to Abel's estate, and that the credits always read ""Wolverine created by Len Wein, Roy Thomas and John Romita"" instead of ""Wolverine created by Len Wein, Herb Trimpe and Jack Abel"".",Marvel,It bugs me that John Romita and Roy Thomas stole the credit for Wolverine from Herb Trimpe and Jack Abel
Comics ,False,"I’ve recently been getting into comics, but I only like to read runs that are shorter than like 20 books. If I have no interest in reading the 90 other books associated with this run, is it still worth buying and reading?",Marvel,Can I read Civil War #1-7 if I haven’t read any of the other books?
Comics ,False,"When I was looking into the Ultimate universe, I saw that Ultimate Spider-Man, and Bendis' overall run of Spider-Man from 2000 to 2018 was consistent with its characters and didn't lean too heavily on the other characters in the universe.

What I got from looking around was this reading order:

1. Ultimate Spider-Man (2000)
2. Ultimate Spider-Man Requiem
3. Ultimate Spider-Man (2009)
4. Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (2011)
5. Cataclysm Ultimate Spider-Man
6. Miles Morales: Ultimate Spider-Man
7. Spider-Man (2016)

So far, I'm about 45\~ issues into Ultimate Spider-Man (2000) and have been really enjoying it! I've not read many Marvel comics, other than Civil War, some Dead Pool, as well as a Marvel Zombies with Howard the Duck.

Some of the characters of the X-Men have appeared (I already know about Parker and Pryde), but some of the references and off panels seem to show stuff from other issues not in Ultimate Spider-Man (Peter has met Wolverine a few times. The Lizard was only shown in one panel. Stuff like that).

I like that it shows that the Ultimate Spider-Man world isn't just Peter Parker and his Spider-Man and highschool exploits, but parts of the stories of Spider-Man in the universe, and not all the issues with show every little thing he does.

That being said, is reading other works in the Ultimate universe needed to read the list I have above, or am I fine not reading the other runs in the Ultimate universe?

Also, I'm not saying I won't get around to reading them at some point, but since I am just focusing on Spider-Man, I am more-so worried about if they are needed alongside it or not.",Marvel,Can I read Ultimate Spider-Man on its own?
Comics ,False,"I was reading a Hawkeye comic today and there’s a part where Hawkeye, Spider-Man, and wolverine are fighting some people. Of course after that Clint walks away basically being like “I’m gonna go watch tv” and Peter (Spider-Man) says “happy Hanukkah” to him. As far as I know Clint isn’t Jewish and I don’t know why he would just say that if no one there celebrates Hanukkah. Now I know Peter is Jewish in spider-verse but it’s still a movie, and I looked it up on Google and I didn’t get a clear answer. Someone please help me, I’m genuinely confused.",Marvel,Is Peter parker Jewish (in the comics)?
Film/Television,False,"In 1979, on the episode ""No Escape"" of The Incredible Hulk TV series, Jack Kirby appeared in an uncredited cameo. This was the first onscreen cameo in an official Marvel film or TV series anywhere that I know of. This is the only appearance of Kirby in any official onscreen superhero adaptation anywhere that I know of. HMU if there's actually others!

Cheers for your body of magnificent works that has changed the entire world, King Jack Kirby! You have changed all of comics irrevocably and for the better! In terms of pop culture, we are still all in your debt. :)

In 1989, in the film of the Trial of the Incredible Hulk, Stan Lee made his first onscreen appearance in any Marvel TV series or films. He will go on to do many other cameos in a signature move that has enabled us to know who he is.

Thank you, Stan Lee too, for changing our world! We are in your debt too. You have had an indescribable amount of positive impact too! I'm grateful to you too. Excelsior!

Did you know all these film/tv series cameos all came from the original comic books? Stan Lee and Jack Kirby used to cameo together in these works.

Film/Television,False,"It probably won't happen, but the release dates and stories would make sense if it does happen.

Now, Sony has 3 Marvel titles set to release in 2023. Jan 13, June 23 and Oct 6. Kraven is confirmed to be in that Jan slot. Other two slots are untitled. One is in Oct 6. And since it is confirmed that ATSV P1 (Oct 7 2022) and P2 will release a year apart, that slot almost surely belongs to ATSV P2.

This leaves the June 23 slot. The only other film in SSU that is known to be ahead in development than others is Madame Web. So I feel that must be in that slot.

Now my theory is that since Madame Web deals with multiversal powers, and with Lord-Miller recently teasing the possibility of Live action SSU/MCU universe being part of it, it could be that all 3 movies are connected.

Sort of imagine it like Infinity War and Endgame situation. IW came out in April 2018. It ended on a cliffhanger. And after credits gave a tease to Captain Marvel a new character not seen before in MCU. Then we had a CM movie which fully explored her origin. Then CM's post credit set up EG in April 2019.

I imagine they could do the same here. They do ATSV P1 with Miles visiting different universes possibly to help SM 2099 recruit other SM's for a reason we don't know yet. The movie ends on a defeat/cliffhanger. Then the post credit gives tease of Madame Web.

Then they fully explore the origin of Madame Web in her movie in June. Post credit brings us back to speed with ATSV P1 ending.

Then in ATSV P2, Madame Web helps the heroes gather up again for one last stand against the villains in a full multiversal war.",Marvel,My theory regarding SSU (Sony's Spider-Man Universe) future movies and how Madame Web fits in

Film/Television,False,"Ive been a fan of Deadpool since I was about 9 and he's my favorite comic book character. That being said as much as I love Deadpool 1 and 2, there's some things that I kinda would like to see them bring back for the character that made me like the character so much. This is also kinds criticizing some of the more recent adaptations of the character in the comics too. Now I'm not saying they're necessarily bad, I love how the character has progressed from villain to an unconventional hero who eventually even got to be an Avenger. However I loved when Deadpool before was so unhinged and an outcast.

I'd argue a lot of these changes started around 2015/2016 but in the comics Deadpool used to be insane, moreso than in the movies and current comics. Initially Deadpool was a schizophrenic who heard voices (the yellow  and white text boxes) that he'd talk back to that not just also used as a comedic gag  but also used to show why other characters in the universe thought he was crazy (ik the voices were retconned to actually being Madcap inside his head). There were also things like Deadpool flipping out when Juggernaut took off his mask, most likely also a reference to Rorschach from Watchmen but Deadpool refers to his mask as his face in one panel and flips out, as he's very insecure about his face. Stuff like this needs to be shown in Deadpool 3 imo, since he'll be coming into the MCU they have a chance to make him more  unhinged. Things like his depression, sadism, and delusions are part of what makes him interesting because he's an underdog.  In the comics when you'd see him go from something comedic to seeing him in one of his dark fits of rage where he could get very serious all of a sudden or seeing him suddenly reveal how he actually feels made for some really deep moments for the character in the comics, I'd like to see this stuff play out in the movie. With bringing him into the MCU they have more to work with. Which introducing his character like this paves more way for character development.",Marvel,Make Deadpool more unhinged for Deadpool 3
Other,False,"Okay I have a story idea and in the history of Steve Rogers he’s an Irish Catholic son of immigrants. Growing up in Brooklyn to keep up appearances as ‘good Catholics’ they would go to Mass and confession and all that with their neighbors. Steve has a younger sister he gets custody of when Sarah Rogers dies and one day he’s passing through the apartment sees her levitating to draw on her ceiling. When he steps back after she noticed him there she is now standing on the frame of her bed to reach the ceiling. 

My idea is that he would start to assume she might be possessed and wouldn’t want to talk about it with her specifically on the assumption that when you confront a possessed person that is when the entity starts to act up. 

Would that idea drive you guys away from a story? Any feedback would be helpful it’s a really harsh history/nearly rivals relationship between the two. He already calls her a monster for other reasons and then he sees that from her.",Marvel,Cap Question
Comics ,False,"So basically, I wanna go back and read Secret Wars 2015 with a few of the fun tie-in books that came along with it. Comicbookherald's trade reading order more or less recommends reading issues 1-6 of the main SW event, then the tie-ins that interest you, then finishing off the event. I'm just concerned about whether or not any of the series I'm interested in might spoil the other miniseries. The ones I wanna read are:  


* Mrs. Deadpool &amp; the Howling Commandos

Comics ,False,"I can't help but look back on the earlier Spider-Man and think of the number of retcons and missed opportunities such as Mary Jane having a miscarriage and when Peter and Mary Jane gave up their marriage to Mephisto just so Peter can save Aunt May. Reed Richards and Sue Storm got married and have children, heck, even Superman and Batman had children. So why can't happen to Spider-Man? Keep in mind, Peter suffered the loss of his uncle and first love and learned from those experiences, graduated High School into the working on and yet he's still not allowed to have a family? And yes, I am aware there are exceptions like Mayday Parker and Anna-May, but I'm talking about the main continuity Spider-Man. The same Spider-Man whom we've all followed since his debut in 1962.

Basically atsv will have the final swinging scene in nwh in it but Tom gets sucked into another universe out of random. And part of this is because of dr strange’s shenanigans caused a disturbance in the spiderverse. We will probably get Tobey and Andrew too, possibly 616 spidey also.

So I started reading everything from Marvel, and it annoyed me that I didn't have a list, which I can follow and write notes next to comic books which I read.

Fan Made,False,"In this version I pretend Flint Mark and Dennis Carradine killed Uncle Ben on purpose and it's set in the same year as Spider-Man 3

JJ is in his talk show

JJ: we have a special guest today. He saved New York twice. Let's welcome Spider-Man

Peter gets out of the curtains and sits next to JJ's parents

JJ: is everything ok?

Peter: that's exactly how I imagined it

JJ: well that's one of us!

The audience laughs

JJ: do you want to tell us a joke?

The audience cheers

Peter: yeah of course. Knock knock

JJ: who's there?

Peter: The police Mr Osborn. Your father was stabbed by his own glider. He's dead

The audience booes

JJ's mother: no no! You cannot joke about that!

JJ: yeah that's not funny Parker. This isn't the kind of humor we use on the show

Peter: ok I'm sorry. The thing is it's been rough years JJ. Ever since I... killed Dennis Carradine and Flint Marko

The audience gasps

JJ: ok I'm waiting for the punchline

Peter: there's no punchline. It's not a joke

The audience murmurs with disgust

JJ: you're serious? You're telling me you killed those 2 guys who robbed a wrestling promoter's money 3 years ago?

Peter: mmm hmm

JJ: and why should we believe you?

Peter: I've got nothing left to lose. Nothing can hurt me anymore. My life is nothing but a comedy

The audience booes again

JJ: so let get this straight. You think killing those guys was funny?

Peter: I do. And I'm tired of pretending it was not. Comedy is subjective JJ. The system that knows so much decides what's right or wrong. The same way you decide what's funny or not

JJ: ok so you're telling me you did all of this to start a movement so you could become a symbol?

Peter: come on JJ. Do I look like a superhero who can start a movement? I killed those guys because they killed my uncle for no reason and because they were awful. Everybody is awful these days. Enough to make someone crazy

JJ: ok so that's it. You're crazy. That's your defense for killing 2 men?

Peter: no. They couldn't carry a tune to save their lives

The audience booes again

Peter: ugh! Why is everybody so upset about these guys?! If someone you love was murdered you'd definitely want to kill the murderer! I basically got rid of 2 murderers forever and instead of thanking me you're being ungrateful pieces of garbage! And why?! Because George Stacy cried about them on TV?!

JJ: do you have a problem with George Stacy?

Peter: yes I do! Have you seen how it's like out there JJ? Do you ever leave the studio? Everybody just yells and screams at each other! Nobody is civil anymore! Nobody thinks what it's like to lose someone you love! Do you think men like George Stacy think what it's like to be someone like me? To want to get revenge on a person who killed someone you loved? They don't. They think we will be worse than the murderers if we kill them in revenge and that we'll accept it like good little boys! That we won't get vengeful and avenge our loved ones' deaths!

JJ: You finished? It's so much self pity Parker. You're just making excuses for killing 2 guys. Not everybody, and I'll tell you this, not everybody is awful

Peter: You're awful JJ

JJ: Me? I'm awful? Oh yeah how am I awful?

Peter: calling me a spider menace over the years. Inviting me to the show. You just wanted to make fun of me! You're just like the rest of them!

JJ: You don't know the 1st thing about me pal. Look what happened because of what you did and what it led to. There are riots out there. 2 policemen are in a coma and you're laughing you're laughing. Somebody was killed today because of what you did

Peter: Hahahaha! I know! How about another joke JJ?

JJ: no I think we had enough of your jokes

Peter: what do you get...

JJ: I don't think so

Peter: ...when you cross...

JJ: I think we're done with your jokes that's it!

Peter: ...a mentally depressed superhero with a newspaper that hates him and treats him like a supervillain?!

JJ: call the police Eddie! Call the police!

Peter: I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU GET!!!! YOU GET WHAT YOU RIGHTFULLY DESERVE!!!!

Peter shoots JJ in the head with a gun, JJ dies and the audience starts running and screaming with fear

Peter: Hahahaha!

Peter gets up of the couch, shoots JJ's dead body in the chest, makes his Bully Maguire dance and gets in front of the camera

Peter: good night. And always remember it: that's life

The camera shows the Indian head test pattern with the music of the ""Bully Maguire"" scene in Spider-Man 3 and news reporters report JJ's death

According to me the only mistake Sony did is start Venom's storyline from the time when he becomes the anti-hero and moves to San Francisco away from Spidey. They shouldn't have skipped his origin. Rest seems fine to me.

From what I can understand from seeing their upcoming slate,

1. They are introducing villains/anti-heroes in their movies by doing their origin. Then they set them up together for a Spider-Man (presumably Andrew Garfield) vs Sinister Six crossover.
2. Making Madame Web movie to set up Live Action Spider-Verse stories so that they can do them without using other mystical characters like Dr Strange which they don't have rights to. They can't loan him from Marvel every time like they did with NWH.
3. Doing a Live action Spider-Woman movie in co production with Marvel set in MCU.
4. Doing animation movies/TV shows on the side like Spider-verse and sequels/spinoffs like ATSV, Female teamup movie of Silk, Spider Gwen, Spider Woman, and Spider-Ham Tv series.
5. Setting up an interconnected live action TV universe starting with Silk.

Their plan seems pretty good to me. If done right, they can create a great MCU style universe in multiple mediums with Spider-Man related characters which MCU won't ever have time or space to do since they are already juggling so many characters.

One more benefit that Sony has is they can do a wide no of animated movies ranging from PG to R. One thing Disney and hence Marvel Studios can't. Also the head of Sony Animation recently said they are working on multiple R-rated to PG movies for different IP's they own.

So they can do some adult themes animated movies for Spidey stories like Kraven's Last hunt, Maximum Carnage, etc. as well as other PG-13 Spider-Man stories. If they can create these stories at the level of Into the Spider-Verse, then they can create their own awesome combination of interconnected and independent animated movies/tv shows at or even above the level of DCAU.

Free roam

To unlock San Francisco free roam, simply complete the main story

Extras
No red bricks just stud amounts
But the stud multipliers only unlock after getting the previous multiplier

2x Studs- 1,000,000 Studs
4x Studs- 5,000,000Studs
6x Studs- 10,000,000 Studs
8x Studs- 50,000,000  Studs
10x Studs- 1,000,000,000 Studs
Disguises- 300,000 Studs
Viking Hats- 300,000 Studs

Features

Silver studs now give you 100 studs
Gold studs now give you 1,000 studs
Blue studs now give you 10,000 studs 
And black studs now give you 100,000 studs

Viking hats now appear in cutscenes 

Now when you get to a point in a level when you need a certain character when you press triangle it automatically switches to the character you actually need

Now when putting in codes you can just use the default console keyboard

Codes are now only 4 characters

Character select screen was converted back to the original circle for icons design instead of the cards from lego marvel superheroes 2

Loads of studs are in the game but now when you die you lose all of your studs and no studs fall out when you die so you can’t regrab them which makes it much more of a challenge than before

If one of your characters get stuck press pause and then a drone will get your character out of the area 

If you press and hold triangle during a story mission then you can choose the character you want to switch to instead of pressing triangle until you get the character you want

You can skip any cutscene

Subtitles are on automatically from the get go, so since most people like them on, it wouldn’t take long for the small amount of people who want them off to turn it off manually

You can save and exit anytime

Combat is like lego marvel superheroes 2 and there’s still health bars (the UI isn’t like a comic book anymore though so it isn’t the exact same)

To unlock Stan lee, complete all of the Stan lee in perils (there’s one in each main mission and 10 more instances in free roam)

100% reward 

Once you 100% the game, a statue of Stan lee with a sign under it saying 1922-2018 will be in the center of the free roam map

Comment below!,Marvel,Which villain would you like to see Spider-Man fight next (spoilers for NWH)

Film/Television,False,"Ultron was supposed to be “a suit of armour around the world” and in a way, he was. 

When Jarvis wakes Ultron up, Ultron wonders where and what he is. Jarvis tells Ultron his purpose and Ultron remembers hearing Tony say ‘Peace in our time. Imagine that’. Ultron starts figuring out what that phrase means and goes through history of all the wars. He sees that when that sentence was first spoken it was only a year later that war broke out around the world again. He learns that war is inevitable when humans are involved and that phrase is ironic and a dream more than anything. Though, his purpose is to protect the world. 

So with a purpose that can’t be achieved with humanity in the way, he moves to wipe out humanity, bringing peace to all time. With doing this he will conclude his purpose, to protect the world. 

He’s an A.I. so he’s going to stick to his purpose no matter what and while he seems a psychopath, he actually shows signs of conflict in his decisions. He almost regrets that this is his purpose sometimes. I noticed when he was awoken by Jarvis that at the end of his history gathering he says: ‘He can’t mean… Oh no’. He’s thinking about Tony’s vision of peace in our time, but Tony wasn’t being sarcastic with the irony of that phrase. “Imagine that”. He was imagining that maybe with Ultron their truly could be forever peace. Ultron’s only way to achieve his “father’s” dream, his purpose, was mass extinction, but he was sorry and slightly guilted in doing so. He apologised to Jarvis and regretted killing him but he had to to be able to fulfill Tony’s image. 

I may be way off here but I feel like understanding this kinda brings a much bigger character to Ultron than how he was portrayed. I feel like this pivot point in Ultron understanding that phrase needed to be more emphasised. He wasn’t just a mass murdering robot, he was a thinking and working brain but limited to fulfilling his mission whatever the cost.",Marvel,The real Ultron?

Film/Television,False,"My hypothetical question was : is the Spider-man series correctly naming thier movies. And is there a link between miles and andrew.G(SM) due to elements utilized to craft the two movies.

Firstly the name of raimi Spider-Man being just that didn't discredit the possibility to naming the series of reference. Which aptly calculated is the amazing spiderman universe BUT with organic webbing. A very straightforward approach with elements of spectacular in 2 and 3. The Amazing Spider-Man title should belong to Tobey Maguire.

Mean while in another universe..

Andrew Garfield's Spider-man bares striking resemblance to the Ultimate Spider-Man. Variable clothing changing a Hoodie, hipster clothes. The overarching storyline of Angst against the Police and his Bullies. Eventually this evolves into a part of his sense of justice as he emotionally approaches the hero work from the angle of confusion and curiosity. This is a Spiderman trait yes but even more so expressed in andrew! That coupled with Normans supposed Death with experiments centered around Goblin Serum puts me at the notation that combined with his parents death due to Corporate espionage which if anyone has read or played Ultimate is a quality that belongs to it. U.Peters parents died coveting a experimental piece of the venom symbiote from Oscorp. Andrew Garfeild is the Ultimate Spider-man.

Meanwhile in a parallel Universe to ASM2..

Tom Holland glides in as a strange mixture of multiple universe traits while outright rewriting peters definition of social intelligence. Id like you'alls help in tracking down a reasonable designation of Tom Hollands Spider-Man as it become more complicated to try and even understand how to name him if i were to reference a specific comic series.

Aside from the naming dilemma id like to propose thoughts on Venoms involvement in Multiple Causality story extension. You see Andrew Garfield's universe ks referenced in the post credits theme along with Tom Hollands. This stood.out to me as cool and peculiar as per Ultimates reality Venom and Peter are Genetically Connected to one another because Peters late parents died to protect the sample from a Oscorp. The very same connection can be inserted into ASM and it wouldn't change the current story status. But for Tom Holland the Black suit and Venom have a very different meaning and the way it'll be incorporated into the Mcu VIA Morbius is a strange and yet oddly reasonable approach. For Andrew who is full of rage, angst and negative emotion +Hypothetical symbiote DNA Venoms almost instinctual attraction to him makes perfect sense. IF Andrew were Ultimate. This was funny to me as the Three Spider-Man scene went on to try and CONVINCE the mass public that based on their Series names that was their designation which i believe IS FALSE. This could result in Marvel Revisiting ASM for an ASM3 in combination with Tom Hollands Spider-Man to result in a Pseudo Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions Movie series as its Totality. The main enemy being Anti-Venom a PARALLEL version of venom. Something very possible because of venoms leaving his suit piece in Toms Universe but option to move to a Sony Spider-man title possibly ASM3. Two Venoms for the price of One; The Multiverse discovery in No way home creating the possibility of including Spider-verse; mind you Miles belongs to the Ultimate Universe. And does not have his own standalone Spider-man series where his origin is not related to Peter Parker.

That leaves room to say the Spider-Verse takes place after the death of Andrew Garfields P.P. which should have provided any spiderfans with the needed info to conclude Tobey Maguire and Andrews inclusion in No way Home. [The writing was on the walls] as the Reference grew deeper to Tobey as the Spider-Tutor provided to Miles wad the Oldest of Our Theatrical Spider-men to represent experience. A slightly unfit fairly weathered Spider-man with a 5-o'clock Shadow. Tobey's exact In Movie appearance in No way home.

Other,False,"Just finished reading all of Moon Knight and there are multiple storylines where Khonahu either betrays or generally treats Mark like shit. There’s a storyline where Khonahu tries to beak Mark’s mind and take over his body, which is proceeded by a storyline where Mark finds out Khonahu has a creepy cult that’s murdering people. It takes Khonahu taking over the world to finally convince Mark it’s probably not a good idea to keep listening to the psycho moon god. I know Mark’s whole thing is he’s unwell but you’d think he’d wise up sooner than he did. It’s probably because I read all these comics back to back instead of over years like they were published, it’s just weird that multiple books end with Mark and Khonahu having a falling out only for it to be ok in the next one.",Marvel,Why does Moon Knight keep going back to Khonahu?

When Thor had to kill Gorr to stop him from committing complete and utter deicide, he had to wield All-Black the Necrosword, which IS a Symbiote, in fact it’s THE Symbiote.

Also Disney (owners of marvel) have been trying to copyright Loki, not just the character but the actual God.

I cant help but ask you, please be mindful on other subs, be mindful of those who cant see it, to those that can't risk going to a crowded place, or to those who simply don't have a cinema open.

This isnt about politics or anything covid related, just a cry from a big superhero fan to other superhero fans.

Thank you. 
**Sorry for my bad English.",Marvel,I saw a ton of spoilers and I cant see the movie
Merchandise,False,"Hey'all!

I just wanted to share a project I've been working on for quite some time.

# Comic Book Tabs

They are basically a stick that you put into your comic book shelf, with an icon showing what comics are next to it. So a way to sort and arrange my comic bookshelf.

I've gotten obsessed with creating them, and I have a big list of new ones I'm gonna make. And I want to make a shorter version for manga as well.

I haven't seen something quite like this before, have you?

I'm not sure how to add images to the text, but there should be some pictures linked to this post somehow, not sure how it works.

Here's a link to an image gallery on IMGUR: [https://imgur.com/a/plBGZX8](https://imgur.com/a/plBGZX8)

*Note: In the imgur gallery, I also link to an etsy store I set up just for these tabs.*",Marvel,Comic Tabs - Comic Bookshelf Sorting Accessory
Film/Television,False,"If dr. Strange made everyone in his universe forget peter, why did it affect everyone in the other universes leave if they still remember him. If they too don’t remember peter, dr. Strange just ruined spider mand life an infinite number of times. 

Also it’s bs that he couldn’t have just made everyone forget that peter was spiderman, which was the original spell",Marvel,More dr strange bs no way home
Film/Television,False,I want to rewatch the ultimate Spider-Man series to expand my knowledge of the non MCU heroes So i can read the comics of the characters I'm interested in. I've heard from some that the series isn't true to the heroes source material. Is this true?,Marvel,Is the ultimate Spider-Man cartoon a good representation of the heroes and villains included?
Comics ,False,"Marvel's built up a ton of characters over the decades, but not all of them have been given a series of their own.  Maybe they're relatively obscure, or maybe they're better known for being part of a team, but I'm sure there are a bunch of characters who have been overlooked over the years.

For me, three come to mind.  Despite being founding Avengers, [Hank Pym](https://www.marvel.com/characters/hank-pym/in-comics) and [Janet Van Dyne](https://www.marvel.com/characters/wasp-janet-van-dyne/in-comics) haven't gotten the sort of treatment or focus that the others have - the closest that Hank's had to a solo series seems to be Tales To Astonish, an anthology series from the 60's, and Janet has never had a solo series despite being prominent enough of a character that her tenure as the Avengers' chairperson is second only to Captain America.

Between the two, it seems like a Janet-centric series would be more fun, but it would be nice to have some consistency with Hank's character - since I got into the comics side of Marvel, he went from being a sympathetic character who thought that AI (aside from Ultron) deserves a chance to live in Avengers AI, to an asshole who views AI (aside from the Vision) as things to be destroyed in Rage Of Ultron, to either having his soul stuck in the Soul Stone or being dead.  I really liked the character in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, and while I'm aware that the comics version is quite different (though it seems like it depends heavily on the writer), it seems like there's a lot of ground for a more introspective story in between super villain battles. (plus, Hank's rogues gallery could add some levity if they need to balance out the serious/darker topics like Hank's struggles with mental health disorders, since aside from Ultron, they're not exactly the biggest threats out there)

As for Janet, there's more to her life than just the team, and while we see bits and pieces of it in the Unstoppable Wasp runs, it just seems long overdue. (and she could use a rogues' gallery of her own beyond Whirlwind)  As of late, she's been stuck in a supporting character role in Iron Man or the Unstoppable Wasp (Nadia, her step-daughter, is the title character), but Janet definitely seems like a character who could support her own series.

Another character that seems like he'd have a lot of potential for a solo series is [Adam Brashear, a.k.a. Blue Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/characters/blue-marvel).  He had a mini-series to introduce the character, and he was great in Al Ewing's Ultimates series, but aside from occasional appearances in the Luke Cage version of the Mighty Avengers and the Dr. Doom series from last year, he doesn't seem to have appeared in much.  Going by his role in the Ultimates, it seems like there's a lot of unexplored history for the character, and there's a lot of opportunities for Fantastic Four style cosmic weirdness.

Those are just the characters that come to mind for me, but who do you think has some unexplored potential for a series of their own?",Marvel,"Which character(s) should get a solo series, in your opinion?"
Film/Television,False,"1. Couldn’t strange alter the spell, (which he did 5 times) to make it so that nobody knows that peter is spiderman? Instead of people just not knowing who peter is? That was the original spell too.

2. This ruins the lives of an infinite amount of peter parkers cause their identity is erased. 

Bonus thing that’s somewhat relevant: venom likely wont go to peter cause he no longer has any idea who he is :(

Somehow this movie has about as much continuity as an x-men movie",Marvel,[SPOILERS!] Why the No Way Home ending makes no sense
Film/Television,False,"Ok, so I only have the hypothesis part of this figured out at the moment to put out there, but... what if J. Jonah Jameson (as played by Jk Simmons) is a multiverse traveler? He has been portrayed by the same actor in all three iterations of spiderman",Marvel,J. Jonah Jameson theory

Comics ,False,"What comic did thanos say “you address omnipotence, tread carefully”",Marvel,Thanos
Film/Television,False,"Dont get me wrong i love anime, but the way they made this was just to damn cringey, how they drew tony stark had me lmao. The fighting style was okay, but having to say your move before you do it like ""boomerang shield"" was freaking corny, yeah it works good with anime, but it didnt with this. whoever did this made it too anime and it just sucked all together.",Marvel,was watching avengers assemble: future avengers and i couldnt watch anymore
Film/Television,False,"So in my first watch I actually really really really enjoyed it. Considered it worth an 8/10. But I'm rewatching it and I'm on the seventh episode already but I mean it's really not that great. Leaning towards a 6/10 now. 
The only likable characters in the show are Lou and sometimes Monica. Sure the gratuitous gore and the comedic element add up with decent plotlines. And it has the potential of being a great sitcom but it really doesn't hit the mark. There isn't any oomph to it.
Thoughts? Opinions?",Marvel,Rewatched Marvel's M.O.D.O.K

Film/Television,False,"Second episode of wandavison opening, surrounding the moon is stars connecting in a shape of a hex.. re-watching a few things",Marvel,Don't know if anyone else seen
Other,False,"For a long time I’ve seen people on reddit, and just western Marvel fans labelling the Ragnarok best of Thor films.

Thor: Ragnarok is a comedy, that has nothing to do with a badass Thor. He became a clown. Ragnarok is supposed to be an end of Asgard. Thor is losing his world, and his father, takes responsibility for his race. But f*ck this, Ragnarok is a comedy now. 

First two films were serious. Loki was portrayed as real mastermind in first two films. He was a threat in first film, nearly capturing an Asgard. But in Ragnarok he is a clown also.

Why is Marvel getting less and less serious each time? Serious plot doesn’t equal to boring plot.

Sorry for my bad english. Not a native speaker",Marvel,Why everyone loves Thor: Ragnarok?
Film/Television,False,I mean like think about it. Thanos didn't make his move until I it's just 2 people he has feared died (Odin and the Sorcerer Supreme). So why when the avengers in endgame made their moves didn't Odin react. We know the Sorcerer Supreme didn't because Prof. Hulk went directly to her. But Fat Thor and Rocket went directly to Asgard. My theory is he didn't do anything because the All-Father already had pre-existing knowledge of the multiverse. Now my friends let's speculate. How could he have already known of the multiverse?,Marvel,[Theory] Odin knew about the time Heist
Film/Television,False,"Just got finished rewatching infinity war. I have to say it has to be the best Avengers movie. I was hooked the whole time. But I do have some questions. Since tchalla called Bucky the white wolf do y’all think they will explore that more in black panther 2 now that Chadwick has passed? Secondly, what was the point of the captain marvel movie? I’m going to rewatch it tonight but I don’t remember nothing connecting to the mcu after that movie and never seeing the skrulls again. I came here for enlightenment or understanding, don’t attack me lol",Marvel,Infinity War
Film/Television,False,"The entire movie is slapstick comedy with seemingly no redeeming qualities. Is this what they intend for their only antihero arc that did kind of decent? I'm not talking about the mcu. I think Sony or someone else owns the venom IP? 

I'm just confused. How could they look at what people had to say about the first film or contemporary films and make venom 2 just a slapstick horror show? They don't even do either trait very well imo. It's like we regressed to lazy story telling where the story boards are caricatures of actual events and they decided instead of fleshing that out this is what made it to the screen?

Am I alone if feeling this way? The jokes don't stick. The fight between Eddie and venom was unnecessary seeing how Carnage comes to be independent of Vernon's knowledge. Sure it could be fun watching venom running about flawlessly but we never needed Eddie to be anything more than an unfortunate or reluctant hero which venom invites. 

It just seems terrible. Almost like this belongs in the Raimi films with the level of cheesy dialogue carrying every scene but without any of the classic qualities of the Raimi films that made them fun. 

I hope this movie bombed and they sell it back to MCU/Disney. I'm supremely disappointed and hope another antihero or reluctant hero character I've loved a lot, Moonknight, does much better. 

I've been on the down spiral of disappointment since age of Ultron didnt have wolverine who was literally instrumental in one of Ultron most iconic and undeniably based arcs by similar name. I was still impressed in theaters with Ultrons animations and simple but efficient motivations enough to be agreeable, I guess. 

But man this just makes me not even want to tune in and I keep checking out of the films. Especially since they are so often targeted at children or to be family friendly. I like it when that's done well but this is fucking venom's story not the avengers. Imagine if Spawn, one of the most reluctant antiheroes, got done this way? That'd be so fucking bad I couldn't accept it as canon bruh",Marvel,I just watched venom 2: let there be carnage
Film/Television,False,"Never saw it before, heard about all the troubles in production, and it ultimatley just skipped by me, but I figure since we're in a much different place now and the F4 are earning their proper reboot in the MCU, I'd check it out. 

I have a passing to decent familiarity with the source material, mostly from the original movies, the Spider-Man animated series, and a few others things here and there, and I did read some comics like Secret Wars (80s) so I think a good enough baseline to know what the F4 should be. 

Overall..... Not too bad, but certianly not great. I was actually really into it for the first half or so. There was a good movie here, but then it fell off a cliff in the second half (Which apperently where most of the reshoots and set problems were, it wasnt hard to tell). 

\- I liked the cast. I'm used to the characters being on the older side so it was odd seeing them younger, didnt really mind though. The actors worked well enough with what they had so I hope they get an Andrew Garfield style redemption someday under better direction. 

\- Doom looked very.......not good. The scene where he was walking around the facility exploding people was awesome but his design was so bad! This guy is one of the greatest villians of all time and he certianly wasnt done justice here 

\- The pacing was off. Like I said, I was really enjoying the first half, even though it took way too long to get things going, it was fine since it was building up the characters. It reminded me of the Power Rangers movies that came out recently. That one also took so long to get the team together and get into the actual costumes, but in that movie, the buildup worked because the payoff was worth it, and the stuck the landing for the last hour or so. I dont think they did that here, it felt like the climax of this movie was the second act, and then it just...ends. 

 So yeah, not the unmitigated disaster I expected it to be, but certianly not something that measures up to what the Fantastic 4 deserve, and I'm glad they're in the MCU and John Watts hands now. Kinda feel like rewatching the original now and seeing how it compares",Marvel,I watched Fant4stic for the first time
Film/Television,False,"Let me preface this by saying I LOVED No Way Home. Extremely well done an worth all the praise and money it's earning.

However, just like any movie it's not without flaws... One time I pointed out that in End Game during the final battle, they reused the exact audio clip within 5 seconds of each other. Cap gets the hammer and brings lightning down on Thanos - ""eeaarrrhhh"" then exactly the same ""eeaarrrhhh""

So I'm risking Reddit's wrath and pointing out a few things from the latest and greatest, in no particular order.

-Tom Holland grunts and over saturation of ""exertion"" noises while fighting, but especially while swinging. I noticed it most in the very last scene. He wasn't doing anything particularly stressful for Spider-Man, but we still hear him as if it's a hard time. 

-Spider-Man again... Holland'a Spider-Man does his unique pose far far too often, and for no reason. His version is crouched with one hand on the floor, and one outstretched. However... He does it many many times in this film where it doesn't make sense. He was in this pose the entire time talking to Dr. Strange at the end. But why? It served no purpose... Like most the times he did it. Which is a TON. Rewatch it again and you'll notice too. 

Ned - I'm sorry, but his actor and character are not funny. They had to ""make him magic now"" just to make him seem important, which he's not. Just a vehicle for the audience and their nonsensical questions and to make often times horrible one liner jokes. Also the ultimate 3rd wheel to Peter and MJ. So often he'd but in on their moments and was always awkward. Human beings don't act like this.

Last minor nitpick - you could tell who was on set and who wasn't. The actor for Lizard did a far better job than Sandman. CGI was great though. The callback lines were amazing the first time. More viewings it felt forced. How many times does Otto say the ""power of the sun"" line?

So! I'm expecting to be disagreed with and explanations for my tiny bit of negatively, but It's still fun to point out flaws in what many consider the newest masterpiece.

(yes it's possible to love something while acknowledging its flaws)",Marvel,(SPOILERS) My very few nitpicks with spider-Man No Way Home
Film/Television,False,"Also, do you think he's Tony Stark is a 1610 version of the MCU multiverse? Could he be called Antonio Stark in this one?",Marvel,Do you guys think that Tom Cruise will be the new MCU Tony Stark?
Comics ,False,"I know the first universe was called the First Firmament. He was conscious, aware, subjective, and sentient. When I read about it/him, they never say he was created by The One Above All. Then a war broke out between the Aspirants and the Celestials. The Celestials eventually won, and the remnants of the First Firmament fled. The second universe/first multiverse was called Eternity. I know Eternity is the embodiment of the universe. He is an actual person, with a mind and all that. I've read all universes within the multiverse are called Eternity; not just Earth 616. So how can the multiverse itself be Eternity when each universe has that title? That's what I don't get. Also, they say the current universe is the 8th iteration I believe. So, wouldn't that just mean new universes are being created (like timelines)? Or is it just that Earth 616 dies and then is recreated multiple times? Or is the multiverse as a whole just dying and being recreated? Also, I know The One Above All created everything, but on fan sites (even the Fandom site) it never mentions that. Why?

And something else I wonder about: I remember reading the universe was created by a being that pretty much committed suicide. And when he did, that created the infinity gems.

So, I don't really get this. Was it The One Above All who created the multiverse? Was it some being that offed himself? Is Eternity the Universe (and also the name of each individual universe)? Or is he the Multiverse? Is Eternity just pretty much a title?

Also, I've read about the metaphysics of reality in the comics too. And one thing I don't understand is when they show Eternity (as 616), they never show other similarly looking beings: Eternities. Why is that? It's always just a huge, white nothingness plus whoever he is interacting with.",Marvel,"Can someone solve this mystery for me about the cosmic entities of the comics, please?"

Why did I also pick Ant-Man? He can control and communicate to ants, he can shirk down to almost nothingness, and he could grew as big as Big Ben so he could squish you.

Comics ,False,"I'm writing an original story. A scene involves Loki offering ""help"" to the main team. Prodigy and an OC are on the team, and both are able to discern his ulterior motive through their respective telepathic powers. Prodigy's telepathy isn't really normal telepathy per se, and OC is a magic-user who specializes in magic-based psionics. I was thinking about if and how their differing types of telepathy may vary in effectiveness against Loki, and it made me wonder how well Loki is at defending against psychic attacks in general, which got me wondering even more how Asgardians would fair against human and mutant telepathic probes.

I've been into Marvel comics for about a year, but I don't recall ever reading about an interaction like this. Is there a precedent here?",Marvel,How susceptible are Asgardians to mortal telepaths?
Film/Television,False,"I haven't seen this discussed anywhere but I apologise if I'm covering something people are already aware of.  

As we know, by the end of No Way Home, the Peters successfully cure Max Dillon, Norman Osborn, Otto Octavius, Curt Connors, and Flint Marko before they are all returned to their respective universes. I’ve been thinking about the impact those cures would have on the Raimi-verse and Webb-verses once the characters come back. 

For example, if you look at the Raimi-verse, the chronological order in which the various characters were “summoned” into the MCU is as follows:

* Norman Osborn
* Otto Octavius
* Flint Marko
* Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) 

The film explicitly told us that the three villains were summoned right before they died (except for Flint, who did not die, so let’s assume he disappeared at some point during the big fight at the end of Spider-Man 3), while Peter himself has aged a fair bit - let’s assume he is from the present day, so 2023? So the four individuals were plucked from the Raimi-verse and dropped into the MCU, and then reappeared back in the Raimi-verse at roughly the same time as when they disappeared, after experiencing the events of NWH. 

Let’s consider the final showdown between the Green Goblin and Spider-Man at the end of Spider-Man. They’re beating the crap out of each other, Green Goblin has the upper hand, and then he winks out of existence for a second, and comes right back wearing different clothes and with no more powers. Let’s assume he explains to young Peter what just happened and they make up. Norman Osborn is redeemed and he builds a better and brighter future. 

But what happens to the “future” we saw in Spider-Man 2? Where is Octavius going to end up when he winks back into existence no longer controlled by his mechanical arms? There’s every chance that a non-Green-Goblin Osborn would work with Octavius on his fusion reactor thing so that it wouldn’t get out of hand. Either way, the sequence of events leading up to the fight at the end of Spider-Man 2 would be astronomically altered, not to mention the events leading up to the wise Peter Parker we saw Toby Maguire portray in NWH. 

Perhaps the events of NWH would cause multiple timelines to split from the main timeline. But depending on how serious the TVA really is about their job (I know we’re all skeptical based on the ending of Loki), surely they would rock up and prune all of these variants out of existence, making the Peters’ events completely redundant. Or maybe &gt;!He Who Remains doesn’t care!&lt;. 

It’s possible that none of this will be addressed in future films, but based on the multiverse direction Phase 4 seems to be leaning, maybe it actually will. It’s possible that Peter Parker and Dr Strange’s antics from NWH ended up breaking the Raimi-verse and Webb-verse, which will be something Dr Strange will need to contend with in his next film.",Marvel,The implications of No Way Home on the greater multiverse

Comics ,False,"I absolutely love Thor, he's easily my favorite Superhero ever. The God of Thunder,Rebirth,Unworthy Odinson,King Thor,and 2018 runs are legendary, as well as War of the Realms being my favorite Marvel event. But his recent run seems like a ln unnecessary regression for him and his allies.

For Thor it's many things 
- For one I don't like how he is being portrayed as a bad King. After all the struggle he went through for 4 years to secure peace for him to then be shown as horrible ruler who is so bad they call it the ""Black Reign of the Thunder King"". This makes it seem like he hasn't grown at all despite everything 

- Second, I hate how he treats his friends. He beats Beta into the ground then shatters Stormbreaker in front of him when he could have easily knocked him. He threatens Sif multiple times even though she only wants to help him. He starts to ignore the words of his friends ""because he is King now"" but it comes off as him being and asshole.

-Third, why did the writer feel the need to include that conversation where Thor straight up say that he doesn't ever remember or barely remembers any of the conflicts he and the avengers have dealt with. It makes it seem that all of the stories and bonds we've seen him make are only like a movie he's binged through and I hate it

For Odin, why did they have a complete regression in character for him? By the end of the War of the Realms he mended his relationship with Freya,got over his drunken ways,and finally embraced his sons saying how proud he was of him and even gave up his crown he so stubbornly held onto in Jane's run. But in this recent series he does a complete 180 by ruining his marriage, drinking again, and treating his kids like he did before his arc. This was completely unnecessary for the writer to do,like why couldn't he just leave the parents to happy ? Instead he introduced a very forced conflict that didn't need to exist

And Finally Mjonir. Why did they give the hammer an evil persona? It completely destroys every character arc that focused on the hammer and the burden of being worthy. So for Jane, instead of her being worthy of Mjonir ,the hammer chose her because it was ""bored"". For Thor, it only choose him for his talent of war and combat, not for his various heroic deeds . Then they put the spirit of Mangog just for fun. This change basically retcons Thor's history and make the Hammer seem like a piece of shit rather than a noble

Comics ,False,"Hey! I am one of those dumbasses who watched a few movies and then went and read every comic I could. I have a good understanding of how most of the 'big' things work in the Marvel Universe. But I have a couple of questions I'd love to ask some experts to clear some of my confusion up.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I understand the different realities/universes. But how chronological are the stories of a single hero? For example, the Iron Man of E-616 has had hundreds of stories, all chronicling his life. But do the stories always follow on? and is there major continuity? Will something from an early-ish story like his time with the Illuminati be mentioned in a recent story? Is there a definitive timeline for those single heroes in their own reality? 
2. KANG. Again, I understand the story and theory behind Kang, I have watched a good few videos and read some great stories. But how does Kang always have seemingly one central mind over thousands and millions of years? I understand he is able to travel to any point in time, but according to his wiki, he is only 70 years old. I am just confused as to how Kang Prime has seemed to live for far more than 70 years.

Comics ,False,"I’ve been doing some thinking, and I realize that the Ultimate Universe was ahead of its time in a way, it was made to allow new readers to get into Marvel comics, which I feel is more important now than ever thanks to the MCU, so it makes sense marvel should try another version of the Ultimate Universe.

It would be a great way for new readers to get into the Marvel comics, and allow writers to reinvent classic characters and storylines. I get that's what the original Ultimate Universe was for, but because of *The Ultimates 3* and *Ultimatum* the universe went downhill, but if Marvel tried again they would know not to make an edge lord gorefest that kills characters off just for shock value, which would allow them to keep this theoretical new ultimate universe running for longer.

And because Ultimate Marvel already has a built-in fan base, plus all of the potential new readers thanks to the MCU, they wouldn’t need to start as slowly as they did back in 2000 and could begin publishing multiple new titles in the first year. Also, thanks to the success of the MCU, we could get Ultimate Eternals, Ultimate Shang-Chi, or Ultimate Guardians of the Galaxy. All of I’m saying is that the possibilities of a new Ultimate Universe are endless and Marvel should consider trying it again.",Marvel,Marvel should try another Ultimate Universe.

Comics ,False,"I saw marvels ultimate motion comics on Disney + it was only 4 episodes.

Film/Television,False,"So, I think everyone knows by now that Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness looks freaking awesome, and the trailer was really great too. It didn't show too much while still giving us an idea of what the movies about, that being Strange needing to repair the Multiverse after the events of NWH, while also stopping a mysterious evil force from destroying everything, the tone, structure, and Atmosphere feels very much like Cosmic and Gothic Horror film, on top of having Raimi signature style, The soundtrack they used was very well done, it looks like it'll be as trippy and crazy with the visuals, just as much if not more so then the first film, and overall the film looks and sounds like it's going to be something special and epic.

But I wanted to focus on my predictions for What the general premise will be. Well, okay we know what that will be, Strange having to repair the Multiverse, but I want to focus on the role of America Chavez in the film. America Chavez is going to be making her on screen, MCU debut in this film, and it seems like she will have a huge part to play with her creating star Portals and travelling the Multiverse with Strange and all that. However we also see a lot of creatures and such going after Strange, this leads me to my prediction.

While I believe the main plot will be Strange having to repair both the Multiverse and his world from destruction (the trailers showed New York in a similar world ending position to what we saw in Episode 4 of What If...?) After tampering with the Multiverse when he attempted the spell to erase Peters memory, but I think it will have a Subplot, that subplot in question will be protecting America Chavez, due to her being the key to restoring the Multiverse and everyone wanting her for there own reasons. 

You have Strange protecting her and getting her helping in saving everything, but we also have seen Mordo in the trailer, who, if he is continuing his crusade of killing all sorcerers and removing spells and healing caused by sorcerers, then he could be going after her to kill Chavez due to his believes that ""There are too many Sorcerers in the universe"" or I guess in this case, Multiverse.

We also see Stephen Strange Supereme in the trailers, with the trailer sort of implying he will be the main villain, now this is obviously a misdirect, not that he won't be a villain, I do think he will be a threat to Doctor Strange In the film, because why market it as Strange fighting an evil version of himself if it's not what the film is going to be, the real misdirect is that he won't be the Main villain of the film, I do think he will be a secondary antagonist, or a red herring villain until the true main antagonist is revealed in the third act (I'll talk about who I think that will be later) but I don't think he's going to be the main villain of the film. 

Or maybe the trailers aren't lying and Strange Supereme really I the main antagonist of the film, idk, i mean we see Wong being restrained by magic that looks similar to Stephen's Magic and a light shining on Wongs face so maybe Stephen Strange Supereme is the big bad, though it would weird if that's the case, since they'd be playing there cards pretty early, but then again Wandavision played there cards when it was revealed was Behind everything, so idk anymore (like I said though, I'll talk who I think the true main antagonist could be if not him later). 

But I do think he could be going after Chavez in order to use her in one last attempt to bring back his Christine, which I think him finding out about Chavez and her power would be a good explanation for why Strange Supereme has seemingly relapsed and has become Evil again. But those two won't be only ones going after her. In the trailer we also see Wanda is going to have a big role, the trailers market it as if she will be an ally for a majority of the film, and while I think that could be the case, it's also possible they could be hiding certain thing about in the role in the film. There are rumors that Wanda may actually be the main Antagonist of the film, now I don't think there entirely true, I personally think Wanda will have a similar role to what Tony had in Civil War. 

Where, shes not a villain persay, but her goals and motivations don't align with Doctor Strange and it leads to conflict, that conflict would be Wanda maybe wanting to use Chavez to try and find her children, perhaps she will even rip through the Multiverse to go after Strange and Chavez. Also earlier in the trailer we see a shot of Wanda doing her magic trick with her hands, and behind her is a portal that looks to be the door way the TVA used. Implying that they maybe going after Wanda for something, perhaps for ripping through the Multiverse, but it's also possible they could also be going after Chavez, due to them seeing her as a threat to the now damaged Sacred Timeline (this is also how 2012 Loki could play a part in some way if he is in the film, with him trying to also protect Chavez from the TVA).

But now to talk about what I think the true main antagonist is going to be (if it's not actually going to be Wanda or Strange Supereme), in the trailer we see none other then what looks to be Gargantos fighting Stephen in the streets of New York, this leads me to believe that Shuma-Gorath is the true main antagonist of the film (Though they will probably call him something else or merge him with a character like Cython due to the whole Rights Issues thing), and the one truly pulling the strings in his endeavor. 

With him sending Gargantos to try and deal with the Sorcerer Supereme, and after that presumably fails, he instead manipulates Wanda and Strange Supereme into doing his bidding, without either one knowing it. I personally think he would be pretty good as an antagonist of this film, and him being yhe true puppet master would make for a pretty dramatic reveal and epic finale. But why would he want to stop Strange from repairing the Multiverse and why would he want Chavez? I don't really know, maybe it could be that with He Who Remains now dead he wants to rebuild the Multiverse in his own image maybe? And Chavez may get in the way of that?

In conclusion I personally think the main plot will be repairing the Multiverse and the main MCU, which the subplot will be everyone wanting Chavez and Strange having to protect her, with Mordo wanting to kill, Wanda wanting to use her to find her children, The TVA possibly wanting to Prune both her and Wanda due to them seeing both of them as a threat, Strange Supereme wanting to her to try one last time to bring back his Christine, and Shuma Gorath using both Wanda and Strange Supereme as his unknowing Servants (as well as Gargantos at the beginning of the film) to either kill her because she may get in the way of his plans, or use to advanced his plans in someway. But there is one more thing I want to mention before I close off. The themes and message of the film.

With Raimi being involved I feel there may be some sort of heavy theme and message throughout the film, his Spiderman trilogy is proof of that, and I think the message of the film will be learning to move on. This is hinted at the trailer, we see the glass of the watch Christine gave Stephen in the first movie shattered, which is also meant to represent the stat of the main timeline and the Multiverse as a whole, but it could also represent the fracture relationship between Stephen and Christine, also a lot of things have changed since Stephen got snapped and blipped back, Wong is now Sorcerer Supereme and in the trailer we see Christine going to get to someone else. 

On top of that we also see other characters whom are unwilling to move on, we see Mordo, who is unwilling to move on from his quest and the fact that The Ancient One pulled magic from the Dark Dimension, we see Wanda who, despite everything she went through in Wandavision is unwilling to move on from the lose of her children judging by the end credits scene of the series finale for Wandavision, We see Strange Supereme Relapsing (or at least that's what's implied) and still unwilling to move on from the death Christine, and we see hints to the TVA whom despite the Multiverse returning are unwilling to accept that and trying to restore the Sacred Timeline, as seen in the finale of Loki Season 1 there are TVA members going through Portals to prune timelines despite the fact there's no real point in doing that. We could even see 2012 Loki go through something similar with him unwilling to move on from Sylvie, if he is even in the film of course.

I think we will see our main Strange (God it feels really weird and awkward saying that) struggling with this, struggling to move on from his former life, struggling to move on Christine and the fact that someone else is Sorcerer Supereme, and struggling to move on from the fact he can restore the Time Stone (the reason say that is that the official summary mentions Strange looking into stuff involving the time stone, so maybe he is trying to restore it in some way) and in the end tho, Stephen may have to learn to accept the fact he can't have all of it back, he can't keep looking into past, and has to progress beyond, and focus on the future, and how he can make the most out of his new post-Endgame life, yes we will see go to the darker side, as the trailer shows him using Chaos Magic, but in the end he will learn to, while still acknowledging his past and not letting it completely die (Insert Star Wars joke here) he must ultimately move on from it, and look into the future. 

Which I think would be an excellent arc to have, especially for a movie like this....well that and seeing the craziness of the Multiverse, obviously.

Also I hope we get a recreation of that comic panel where Strange, Wanda, and Loki are all fighting side by side.


TL;DR: The trailer looks sick, i the almost Horror like Gothic and Cosmic Atmosphere it gives off as well as that it doesn't show too much and I can't wait. Also the Main plot I think will be repairing the Multiverse after NWH, while the subplot is protecting America Chavez from everyone in whats basically Bioshock Infinite meets Logan meets a Multiversal version of The Fugitive (and yes those two I could think of as examples) with Shuma Gorath (or whatever they will be allowed to call him) as the true main villain, Wanda (possibly) and Strange Supereme acting as obstacles towards Strange, and the main theme Being learning to move on.

There's more to the Inhumans that actually  separates them from the Homo Sapien comparedto the mutants. They were created by experimention on Homo Antecessor and centuries of selective breading. 

Even without undergoing Terrigenesis, the Inhumans have enough genetic difference to be considered a distinct branch of humanity seperate from Homo Sapiens. They live longer, have enhanced physical attributes, and have a lower tolerance to pollution. The baseline humans can't give birth to Inhumans or vice versa. On top of that, they formed a distinct society and culture from the Sapiens. The Inhumans aren't just a nation of powered humans but a distinct species with their own set of language, custom, technology, and culture. Even if Attilan was destroyed, Inuman Society will still prevail. 

Mutants on the other hand are frequently born from the Sapiens themselves. For Krakoaw to work, Charles and Erik would have continuously displace mutants from the human culture they were raised in and  their human family of origin. In other words, joining Krakoa mean rejecting their human identity and non-mutant friends and family.

Alot of mutants who are accepted by their non-Mutant loved ones aren't easily going to be swayed to leave them for this ""haven"" nor have them tagging along to play second class citizen.

I say they have to deviate because in the orginal Marvel universe, the FF are the first of the modern heroes. Spidey, X-men, Iron Man, Thor, all of them follow the lead set by the FF. Because of their early arrival, the FF are rock stars in the Marvel Comics universe, 

But int he MCU, the Avengers have already been around. Iron Man is here and gone. Spider-Man is already part of the MCU. When the FF show up, there's nothing new about them. Also, Reed richards has always been considered one of -- if not the -- smartest guy in the Marvel universse. If he were already around, it's hard to imagine all the events of the last 20 years just ignoring his existence. 

The same would be said about Doom. I think a crucial part of his character is that he rules Latveria -- he's not just a bad guy, he's a world leader. But he's been absent form all discussions so far. But in my opinion, Doom ONLY works in tandem with Reed. 

The scenario I'd like to see would be Reed deciding the world needed something like the Avengers and he intentionally set out to give himself, Sue, Johnny and Ben powers to fill the void. Then, because it has to, something went wrong and ben ended up The Thing. That would make the accident the result of Reed's hubris and assuredness-he-is-always-right, which is a key part of the character.

Film/Television,False,"This Post contains a buncha spoilers from Civil war to endgame so keep that in mind

strap in it’s gonna be long

okay so let’s start from the beginning 
Ignoring the fact the whole reason endgame happend is because tony wanted peter back but we are gonna ignore that for a HOT second.

So infinity war, it’s pretty obvious that peter Cares about tony. Why? he Skips his whole field trip cause he sensed trouble and then immediately saved me stark. Also it’s canon that peter was the kid in iron man 2 with the mask on. you can hear a lady screaming peter in the clips. Anyways yeah we all know peter cares deeply abt mr stark, now for those who say tony dosent care abt peter you are *COMPLETELY WRONG* 
in Endgame, In the beginning. The first words he said where not “there all gone” but “i lost the kid”. Not that half the avengers where gone, but that the kid was gone. also the fact he dosent call peter by his name but as “kid” like he’s his Actual kid. and when tony’s screaming at steve he mentioned that he lost someone important to him, or around those lines. we all know that was peter “ohhh bUt Wat iF iT wA S someone eLsE” PETER PRACTICALLY DIED IN HIS HANDS YU CANT TELL ME HE ISNT TGAT PERSON- 

then again the whole reason endgame happend was because of tony wanting peter back. prove me wrong, then tell me why he loooef at a picture of peter then figured out a whole voter of time machine shit to go save the whole universe. DUDE TONY WAS INSPIRED BY PETER TO SAVE THE UNIVERSEHAHDHDJDH. 

he also knew he was gonna die from this because obviously edith and shit. But he died because of to save peter and the universe. and once peter came back and acted all confused tony hugged him…. HE HUGGED HIM. FLASHBACK TO THE CAR INCIDENT ID SAY THAT CHARATER DEVELOP MENT. 

yah then he died-
anyways at his funeral he also was in front, in movie logic, that means he was important. 

also when tony had that dream of him having a kid and that it was “so real”
you cant prove me that that wasent a metaphorical reference to peter.

He manages to free the green people and tells them that they should live in peace but later when he goes back to earth in a rocket he sees that the green people are torturing and enslaving the people that had made them slaves before.

Comics ,False,"Sadly, I never read many comics about Doom. I only read the best modern stories about him digitally, like *Doomwar*. I know what his motivations are in that comic and how are they presented in other newer stories like *Secret Wars*. He is a unique villain, for certain.


I have read older *Spider-Man* comics though, where he appears a few times and he honestly didn't feel much different from the rest. Obviously, it's not his or Fantastic Four's comics so he wouldn't be fleshed out much, but he still seemed like a typical 60-70s villains: power as motivation.


I have been told that Magneto and Doom were exceptions to the rule even at that time. For Magneto I see that he was always not just evil for the sake of evil or power and that he was a sympathetic villain, but I am not so sure about Doom.

Comics ,False,"I just finished The Age of the Sentry and I’m not sure if I got this right. 
At first i always thought the Sentry has a split personality and is also the Void, but in The Age of the Sentry #6 Reed tells Franklin a story where it seems like the Void killed the Sentry, absorbed his power and now the Void is the one with a split personality and is also the Sentry. 

Did i got this right?",Marvel,Sentry/Void
Film/Television,False,"Hey guys so I had a thought. Before I continue it is about the ending of Eternals so If you haven't saw it yet maybe stop reading. 

Ok so at the end of Eternals there is a dead Celestial on earth. We know from knowhere that mining the insides of celestials that there are all kinds of stuff and materials inside them that have value.
Do you think we will see the government's mining the dead Celestial or maybe that it is going to be similar to Wakanda and Vibranium and depending on the location of the celestial just the country it is in gets to mine it and really look into it. 

Or that maybe there are going to be more extraterrestrial visitors on Earth because they will want to get the Celestial for them self's.

In my opinion they could use the dead celestial to study them and see what could hurt them and maybe even how to locate them.

Just let me know your thoughts in a comments If someone asked this already I am sorry It's just a thought I had like minutes ago and I want to know what you guys think the future of the celestial could be. Do you think it's going to have a role in the future of MCU or it's just going to be in the background with out much focus on it?",Marvel,The dead celestial in the MCU
Film/Television,False,"This is the worst MCU film to date. The film wasn't given proper development. Personally I think it should have been a Disney+ Original TV Series. So that way they can do more stuff with them and give them proper development.

Film/Television,False,"OK so I am only just finishing season 1, so please no spoilers.

So I never really cared about daredevil.  I'm not really a marvel superman so for a long time, heros like widow, Hawkeye, Luke, Jessica, any xmen that wasn't cyclops or wolverine and daredevil to an extent seemed boring.  But I'm going through the mcu, trying to get better.  Yes I Stull skipped shield and Jessica.  May skip Luke and iron fist, not sure yet.  But I did think daredevil was ok back in the day from the Affleck movie and from ultimate alliance., so I fave it a shot (marvel fans forgive my child eyes that look at cool suits before character details)

Oh my God.  This show is amazing!  I just finished season 1 and every single episode is a banger.  Not one stinker out there.  Every one had me either tearing up, cheering, or yelling.  Evoking feelings, for me who has trouble emoting, is the best thing a show or movie can do.  The choice for Fisk was perfect and it's so refreshing seeing a villain that isn't an overconfident ass on a hill.  This Fisk is almost like he's Still a shy child.  But a child with a temper.  Almost like a better pulled off kylo Ren.   This is also one of the only TV shows that really made me care about literally all of the side characters.  Even that lawyer lady from the people representing Fisk (i can't remember names for shit) and I loved her tiny little redemption arc.  Usually in shows I tend to not really care for some side characters, but honestly basically everyone felt integral.

This bring me to the combat.  Fuck me.  Oh fuck me it's so nice.  I'll say this to start.  This is how batman should be.  Not bulletproof.  A man.  The choreography is amazing, and all the fights are good, but it's not even about that for me.  It's the fact that you can see that he's just a man.  You can see him get tired as he goes, struggling to keep going.  it makes it all feel so real and grounded.

Anyway, most of my thoughts have vanished before I even started writing, but all in all I am so happy with this show and I am so glad I gave it a shot. I'm really hoping the next two seasons are good and I really hope that they either bring the show back or put them in a movie or something because I am not done with this Daredevil. He's coming back somehow I know, I just don't know how",Marvel,The daredevil show. Holy shit (season 1 spoilers)
Comics ,False,I've seen a lot of threads saying that ultimate iron man and ultimate marvel team up are not canon. So what is actually canon and what's not?,Marvel,What is actually canon in the Ultima Marvel?
Other,False,"I see this a lot, people think that because Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) appeared in NWH that makes it the first MCU movie. Iron Man was the first because Tobey Maguire came from a different universe. The same logic goes for other movies like X-Men and Fantastic Four. They're not in the same universe as the main MCU (Starting with Iron Man). I see the MCU as the universe of Earth 616. Therefore all other marvel films are part of different universes.",Marvel,Spider-Man was not the first MCU movie (NWH spoilers)
Comics ,False,"I used to religiously read pretty much every Marvel comic years ago up until somewhere around the beginning of the post Secret Invasion era. Life got in the way and I completely dropped them. I wanted to get some recommendations on past/current story arcs or runs that are worth getting in to. I don’t really have a character preference as long as it’s a good story. Hell, I’ll even take non-Marvel recommendations (started on Invincible recently)",Marvel,Comic run recommendations?
Games,False,"I remember watching the Square Enix Presents show featuring Marvel's Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy and the chat was absolutely fed up of seeing Marvel anything. Despite the general happiness over Wolverine and Marvel's Spider-Man there were people that said really, Insomniac are working on two Marvel games? And even the same thing with Marvel's Midnight Suns. I'm curious why you think that is? Marvel is such a rich and beautiful world where so many stories can be told in fantastic way through the medium of video games and we've seen that done as recently as Guardians of the Galaxy, so what do you all think?",Marvel,Why do people say they're tired of Marvel Games?
Film/Television,False,"I think Mystique would be a good launch point for MCU mutants. She could hold her own weight in Solo films/shows because she has at least a hundred years of workable material. Because she’s so close to Charles and Erik, she would be able to show both sides of that story as well. Lastly, I think it would be a good way to FINALLY get to Nightcrawler &amp; Rogue’s origins. 

As I wrote this, I realized this is very close to what Fox tried to do with the First Class series, but I think they got lost up in moving to Apocolypse &amp; the Phoenix Force too quickly, killing Mystique in the process (like what! She’s so critical to the entire X-men)  and missed a lot of critical story building. But I think Marvel has an opportunity to show a lot more of Raven’s grittier darker themes now that they’ve expanded beyond just PG &amp; PG-13 films. 

Also her powers make a good transition without immediately breaking the MCU Avengers to X-men power scaling. It would be a good way to be show how (some) mutants could have stayed in hiding and under the radar for so long). And if they’re planning on taking the route of using the Sentinel program, Mystique is a necessary element.",Marvel,I would love to see Mystique at the front of the X-men MCU relaunch

I for one think Spidermans story is just beginning, they have the Superior Spiderman story to tell, The last Remains story, Spider Island, Hobgoblin, Maximum Carnage and way more. 

We cannot get these movies unless we get a well developed Spider Man and that takes 2-3 movies to do, If actors keep leaving after 3 movies then well get the same 3 storys every time and never get deep into the Spider Man Story.

Other,False,"In GOTG 2, Ego goes on a rant about finding others like him to Quill. Now mind you, Ego had been around for an extremely long time- perhaps the literal beginning of time. 

He says he went on a quest to find out what it meant to be human as he set out amongst the stars. But why human? There’s plenty of other civilizations in the cosmos that were undoubtedly older and closer to him than Earth. And it’s at this point he says “that’s when I found what I sought. Life. I was not alone in the universe after all.” Now mind you, he could be talking about any sentient life, but he already knew the word “celestial”. 

My guess is, as he traveled through space, he came across another civilization where he learned about celestials &amp; sought to go find the other celestials because he wanted to know his purpose. (The scene shows him interacting with an alien race before coming to Earth). The expansion was his attempt to find other celestials.

After realizing he was being left alone, detached from the other celestials, he became resentful. So, in order to find his purpose, he had to get the attention of whoever made him and the celestials. The only way to do that, was to absorb the other celestials &amp; try to make themselves known to him. 

But he realized he was weaker than the other celestials, he wouldn’t be able to take on a fully awakened one. Earth then became his target because Tiamut was still sleeping.  He planted his seedlings on Earth, slowly draining Tiamut’s energy- which was also delaying the emergence. The reason he had Mantis subdue him so often was to see if she could subdue a celestial &amp; train her to eventually be strong enough to help subdue Tiamut.

Quill was only necessary because he found a physical body he could contain his energy rather than just be a manifestation- or Quill actually wasn’t unique, and all of his other children had all simply “failed him” by failing to comply with his request to help conquer the universe. 

When Quill and co. defeated the main body of Ego (I don’t think he’s gone since he had planted so many other seeds), the emergence sped back up because he wasn’t able to siphon Tiamut’s energy anymore. Enter Thano’s journey to Earth &amp; another setback to Tiamut’s emergence.",Marvel,Ego wanted to consume Tiamut theory (spoilers)
Other,False,"So after the first Guardians of the Galaxy film came out, all those characters became household names. Everyone now knows who is Groot, Rocket, and Gamora are.

After Black Panther came out, everyone now knew who T'Challa, Shuri, and the Dora Milaje.

But did any of the characters in Eternals become mainstream?

I'm genuinely asking because I don't know if any of the characters have reached a mainstream audience, at least from what I can tell. This isn't a knock against the characters, as I did like Sprite, Druig, Makkari, Thena, and Phastos. Yet none of them I felt I love as much as other characters in the MCU. I also felt that these characters didn't hit the mainstream audiences the same way as the Guardians or Shuri did, which are both examples of the MCU taking an obscure Marvel property and making them beloved.

I don't know, I'm curious what other people think. Has any of the Eternals become mainstream yet, and if not, who does everyone think will become mainstream in the future?",Marvel,Which of the Eternals will become Mainstream?

I believe the Dweller in Darkness and Soul Eaters in the mcu's version of Shang Chi, will double as some of the first symbiotes created by Knull.

The way the Dweller tricked Xu Wenwu, is really simmular how symboites pull on there host deep desires and ambitions.

Also, the Dwellers brief description by The Marvel Cinematic Wiki, and Knull's attempted sack of earth sound like they could fit into each other.

Thousands of years ago, the Dweller and its army attempted to destroy Ta Lo until they were imprisoned inside a mountain by the Great Protector."" -([https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Dweller-in-Darkness](https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Dweller-in-Darkness) )

I have seen absolutely no theories on this and I have no idea why. I am sure there are holes to why they could be symbiotes, but I honestly think this could be a legitament plot point down the line when we deal with the symbiote dropped off with no way home, or when we finally meet Knull, because he does exist in the MCU

TL;DR with the growing popularity of guardians of the galaxy from Eidos Montreal and Spiderman games from Insomniac and the newly announced Wolverine game along with the midnight suns game from Firaxis, Marvel should expand the portfolio of their video game sector even further. A Jessica Jones detective game with puzzles and well written dialogues and environment design similar to Hitman would absolutely bang. What are your thoughts?",Marvel,Marvel's next game should be Jessica Jones.
Film/Television,False,"For a survivors guilt storyline where someone feels guilt for not saving a loved one, ending it with the character being ‘redeemed’ and saving someone else in the exact same way is lazy writing, and in no way represents actual grief and guilt.

By having Andrew save MJ as a parallel to Gwen, it implies that his guilt was justified and that he should’ve saved Gwen, and that it was his responsibility to. In reality, it was never his fault that Gwen died, he was responsible and did everything he could to save her. The ideal ending to his grief would be accepting Gwen’s death and realising he shouldn’t feel guilty, but continue living his life in remembrance of her- huh, like the ending of TASM2 that they changed for NWH. In real life it is very unlikely that people with survivors guilt get the opportunity to relive the same traumatic moment and ‘correct’ it, so i don’t understand what the message is here.

I assume like a lot of the writing in no way home, they didn’t think very hard and just had these moments because they seemed cool- which is fair enough, do what u want, but it doesn’t make it good writing in my opinion",Marvel,I think a certain character’s ending was written poorly in spiderman NWH (spoilers)

Comics ,False,"Written by Jed MacKay, illustrated by C.F. Villa managed to estabilish MARVEL's strongest female character effortlessly without dropping a sweat. Now they returned to one more issue where they showing us again how amazing they are doing what they are best at.

This is the issue of the week that everyone is going to love no matter why they picked it up for reading.

There is a clear reason why MJ and Felicia are working together in this issue that makes perfect sense, it’s definitely not a forced team-up or anything releated that is so common in similar setups.    
Both ladies use their unique skills while going up against a number of threats to save Peter's life. 

The chemistry they have is simply amazing which should have explore much more earlier and more frequently. It happened here and there before like once or twice in a decade and perhaps this is the fact why it feels so refreshing to read such issues, especially one that makes use of it to bring them closer.

[Luckily we won't exploring how they rival each other but how efficiently they working together as a team and how it brings them closer.](https://preview.redd.it/d351ymjzh7e81.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5550adc0ba7758b976fd31fe517ebdf3ec54f262)

The creative team behind the Black Cat series did not dissapointed.

The way they bonding through the issue the so well written that it could rival the best written comics of past years and we are talking about a kind hearted simple comicbook.

https://preview.redd.it/shjyfabdk7e81.png?width=1988&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44a943a478301a4a25658422e2c6778c3c3ce39e

This is the best part of the issue. We get to see how vulnerable they both why talking about their doubts and how they ended up in the life of Peter Parker.

It's a heartwarming, funny and sassy issue that no one should skip or miss. It fits perfectly into the Beyond Saga but more importantly it redefines the relationship between Felicia and MJ which makes me wish to have more interaction between them in the future.

This issue also ties into perfectly into the Black Cat series that was ended a few months ago and I'm really glad they that the new Spider-Man series returned Black Cat as one of Peter's best friend and soulmate for she recevied a huge love by the artists and writers through her series and hope she will have more spotlight in the future. 

The creative team just reestabilished the best Female character within the Marvel universe by the standards of the modern day.

""Strong female characters **have struggles and flaws just like everyone else**."" - This is something that moders writings (books, movies ect.) tries to do forcefully and it makes them fail right at the start of the writing process while the Black Cat series (2019-2020, 2020-2021+Giant Sized Black Cat+Mary Jane &amp; Black Cat Beyond:1) managed to do it so effortlessly while they remained elegant at doing so.

They eventually came up with a plan to use their last particles to go back in time to retrieve more but, had they not thought of that, wouldn’t it have also been possible for the three of them to just remain in that timeline (2012)? They could have waited there until the battle of Wakanda in End Game and teamed up with the other Avengers to defeat Thanos before he took the mind stone from Vision. They were already SO close as is… Thor was on-time and only inches from killing Thanos. 

I can’t help but think that having an additional Cap, And Iron Man and Ant Man in the mix, they could have stopped him. At the very least kept him at bay until Thor lopped his head off.

To this day I hold it up as the single defining example of everything negative about modern Marvel Comics; not just characters derailed, continuity fucked up, popular changes reversed, and classic stories undermined all to crowbar everything back into an old status quo that nobody wanted back except the editors.

It’s still pretty amazing that Nick Spencer was able to rework it into something palatable with his run… and also bitingly clever that the way he did so was basically just declaring the whole mess to be a deliberate (and *failed*) attempt to literally ruin Spider-Man forever.",Marvel,The worst character assassination you’ve seen in a Marvel Comic?

Film/Television,False,"I don't think it did, in fact Yelena's entire introduction to the larger MCU up to this point doesn't make much sense at all if you ask me. 

I'll explain - At the end of Black Widow, there is post credits scene where Val approaches Yelena and intimates that Clint Barton was the one responsible for her sisters death, right? And the scene ends setting up some kind of future showdown between the Clint and Yelena. 

Now here is what I don't get. The events of Endgame, the lengths that the Avengers went to set the world back right, to bring all those that were snapped away back. You would assume in the aftermath, that would be the biggest news story going. The topic of every conversation. Every talk show.  And you would assume the other Avengers would be very vocal when memorializing those who gave their lives. Documentaries, talk shows, radio shows, podcasts etc. I can't imagine there wouldn't be a media outlet in that world, that didn't want to tell this story. The point I'm trying to make is, the story, and the  circumstances of the death of Tony, Natasha, and Vision. Would be public knowledge, there wouldn't be a single soul on the planet who didn't know the story. 

And then when you factor in that Yelena was one of the ones who came back in the blip. You would think going through something like that and the shock of coming back would be motivation enough to drive her to learn how her sister died, when she learns of her sisters death. And if she didn't hear it on every media outlet talking about it , than how are we expect that she didn't hear it from the Avengers. Natasha tells Yelena in Black Widow that the Avengers are her family. She also tells Yelena that Clint Barton saved her life. Natasha makes it very clear to Yelena that Clint Barton is a very important person to her. I don't believe for a second she wouldn't seek out the Avengers, and/or Clint Barton to get the real story on how Natasha died. 

And if she knows how Natasha died, and given the scope and publicity around her death. It's most likely she does. Her motivation to go after Clint Barton makes no sense. And cannot be justified. Which gives her no reason to be in Hawkeye. I'm glad she was in Hawkeye, but her motivation for being there makes no sense and is just bad writing. The creative team, either willfully ignored the obvious, or wasn't thoughtful enough to consider the obvious. You could have had Yelena in that story for so many other reasons, but the vendetta against Clint Barton for killing her sister. Is not even remotely plausible.   


When you are writing serialized fiction, especially with IP like a Marvel.

No not for likes (look at my account, its a barren wasteland that I care so little about), but because I actually would like to see a difference made after all this time and I gotta speak with a louder voice in the distant hopes that we catch Marvel's ear for once.

I really hope this next run does well. I like Zeb Wells and love JRJR. Its got a really promising group on board. But I saw the other day the post about how marvel has just been on this downward slope ever since secret wars and I really agree. I know there have been a few good runs like daredevil, hulk and venom etc. But I just for the life of me can't understand how they've allowed ASM to be as messy as it is right now. Marvel absolutely botched the previous Nick Spencer run and dropped all of its plot lines which is really just impressively bad decision making on their part. We still don't even know if Dr. Strange fixed peter's ""mind scape"" and we don't know if Peter still is wanting to propose to MJ, we don't even know how the deal effected kindred. I actually think Nick Spencer's run was going to be a really amazing memorable run that fixed OMD, but marvel stepped in and stopped him early. The fact that I as a reader think that the reason the last run ended so oddly/abruptly was due to issues behind the scenes is crazy, we as readers should never feel the need for that to be an explanation. (Also side note, extremely annoying that Dr. Strange died right before ANY of this could be explained, because when they inevitably bring him back, this will probably be long forgotten.)

I just want to quickly chronicle the events of Spiderman over the last decade or so. We get the J. Michael Straczynski run. Then we get the morlun/the other run. Then civil war. These runs all had such a weight to them. The stakes were real, changes happened and stuck. Peter was progressing. Then OMD happens and is a massive massive status quo change. It is a huge detractor from Peter's life, everything changes and he loses the person he loves. And then... its barely ever addressed. I don't know about you guys but for me it feels as if spider-man's true story arc has been on pause ever since.

The last ten years of spider man has had its fun times, but the stakes are kind of just gone in comparison to what came before. Honestly, what has happened since OMD that has effected the story permanently besides maaaybe superior (cause its referenced ALL the time, ((we get it Otto, you love the word superior)))? Ever since OMD there has been this forever elephant in the room that has us wondering, ""Are we ever gonna address that insane shit that happened where Peter's reality was changed for the worse?""

Then Nick Spencer's run happens and it actually started to feel like we are getting back on track. Mj comes back, Kindred knows about the deal, Aunt may is getting sick and the elephant in the room is finally about to get addressed, the story is FINALLY getting unpaused.... and then its just... not.

I have to be honest, if the plan for this run is to break up Peter and Mj again and take us back to what has been happening over the last decade (AKA less weighted/impactful stories), I gotta stop reading ASM for a bit. In today's world we need to learn to speak with our wallets and I don't want to support this flatline for Peter Parker's story. The single Peter stories just feel like more of a pause in what is the ""main"" spider-man story. We've been told countless times that Mj and Peter are meant for each other, they're gonna have may as a child, their bond is unbreakable etc. and we LIKE THAT. If Marvel is really so scared of them being married cause it ""makes it harder for them to write stories"" then just have them be in a basic relationship instead. I just miss feeling like the story of spider-man was actually going somewhere. I'm not saying age Peter up, I think he's at a great place currently, I'm just saying let the guy live a little.


This rant is more about me just wanting more for this character. Trust me, I get it, rants are annoying (downvotes to the left) especially about topics like this, annnd I tend to write very annoyingly. But I'm just bummed cause buying spider man comics is starting to become like paying rent. Yeah I want to do it, but I don't WANT to do it. So Marvel if you drop the ball on this arc, all I gotta say is you'll get your rent when you FIX THIS DAMN BOOK.


P.S. The sad truth of marvel these last few years is that I can't get any of my friends to read the comics anymore. The stories are just becoming meaningless and only rely on referencing the great runs that were happening across the board in the 2000s to 2010s. There is no clear plot, there are no ramifications. We don't know where we are going and there needs to be some guidance. Marvel worked best when it was faithful also to our real world and used that as a backdrop, unfortunately that's just gone now. Frost giants, symbiotes and tree people all invaded earth in the last few years and its basically been treated like a car crash that made the news. In Civil War, Speedball and Nitro blew up a community and school and we STILL are feeling the ramifications of that very real and grounded moment. Disney just needs to let Marvel have its slight edge back, its not working without it. I am hoping that the current kingpin/daredevil arc can bring some much needed stabilization to the overall Marvel story. And if that doesn't work, I just hope that whatever the Maker is currently up to will progress Marvel in a positive way...",Marvel,In regards to the next Amazing Spider-man run...(Spoilers for Marvel in last few years)

Film/Television,False,"What I think is, the Multiverse will be there for around 10 years and the Avengers (including the Mutants in this team cuz I dont think we'll be getting the X-Men as a team) will first battle against: 

1) The Thunderbolts: Where Doctor Doom is actually behind what Val is doing right now (creating the group) and they'll fight the hell out of each other till the interval and they notice that there is a bigger threat above all of them, Doctor Doom, so the thunderbolts basically turn on Doom and team up with the Avengers to fight him and by the end, Kang will call upon Doom and make him the God Emperor Doom (different to the comics).

2) Annihilus: Annihilus escapes the Negative Zone and comes to Earth and tries to Annihilate it but he doesn't succeed, instead, we see Galactus come in and try to, well, eat Earth and then we'll see the Fantastic Four fight Galactus with the Marvels (and the GOTG and Thor)  whilst the Earthly heros fight Annihilus. They win and we get a teaser to Kang at the end.

So here is how the Multiverse connects to both of these battles:

In the Marvel Cinematic Universe in time-line order on Disney+ we see Loki being there before the events of TFATWS. So Doctor Doom being a smart guy, travels from his universe to ours and looks to control it and be the ruler.

But i can not find a picture on google from this angle, that works with the angle of the hedgehog.

Film/Television,False,"So, it's pretty sure that Cavill is playing tbe role of Captain Britain but how awesome woulf it have been if the mcu casted him as Hyperion in a TV incarnation of Squadron Supreme? I don't know if he could have done it considering his job as the witcher 😂, but I feel like he could have done a great job as the one we saw in the last run of the Squad... I feel like Marvel is like ""bro (DC), I'm gonna give you one more chance..and one more after that to produce a good JL movie with great ratings before I make that move"".

Film/Television,False,"I recently came across an article by *The Hollywood Reporter* from March 2019 reported that [Kevin Feige met with several members of the old X-Men cast](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/x-men-hit-marvel-cinematic-universe-at-2021-1195846/).

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Marvel Studios has not publicly revealed any plans for integrating members of the X-Men and Fantastic Four into its cinematic universe, though Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige is said to have met with several members of the *X-Men* old guard in recent months. 

As many of you know, Patrick Stewart confirmed this in January 2020 [in an interview with Digital Spy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a30526782/x-men-marvel-mcu-professor-x-patrick-stewart/). Saying that he had a long conservation with Feige a couple of months ago regarding Professor X.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;""I met with Kevin Feige a couple of months ago and we had long, long conversations,"" he explained. ""And there have been moves and suggestions, which include Charles Xavier.""

Almost everyone of the original cast said that they would love to return to their roles and it seems likely that they we will see the original X-Men again.

otherwise I think it had the best action sequence , visuals and cinematography out of all spidermen movies.",Marvel,"If you were to travel back in time and were in the writing board of TASM2, what would you have changed in the film?"
Film/Television,False,"Just want to throw out a wild theory, get your tinfoil hats ready:

Layla Miller (a.k.a. Butterfly)

It would make sense as to why they're keeping so secret. Since she's a mutant. My other ideas are Spider Woman and Abigail Brand which i've seen a lot of other people saying but why would either of these characters need to be kepts secret? Barely any casual viewers know or care who these characters are. Granted that's doubly true for Layla but she's a mutant. I think given her powers/story and how mysterious and cryptic she is, she could work as the MCU'S first (on screen) mutant. Maybe her ""knowing stuff"" power could include ""remembering stuff"" such as maybe the existence of the mutant race? Maybe someone erased them from history? Maybe, while us viewers are sitting here waiting for a reverse Housr of M, the MCU has already been in a reverse house of M situation this whole time??? Idk, just a theory that will almost not come true at all. Also in the set photos she's kind of dressed like her. 

What does this have to do with Secret Invasion though? I have no idea... maybe the skrulls really are villains and they're the reason for the disappearance of mutants. This idea is barely half baked i'm well aware hahaha.

(Also maybe this has been said before and I'm saying nothing new. Sorry if that's the case.)

P.s. Let's be honest though, she's probably just a Skrull that forgot she's a Skrull

Other,False,"Hero: For me, I've loved Moon Knight ever since I could remember. My first introduction to him was Marvel Ultimate Alliance (Marvel game from 2006) I remember seeing him when I was 6 years old and I asked my dad who this guy was. He told me his name was Moon Knight. I thought he looked so cool and immediately fell in love with the character. Later on I started reading his comics and everything about the character is so fascinating. I love how it's left a little ambiguous as to whether or not he has powers. Maybe he does get real powers from the moon or maybe he just gets inspired. Another thing I love is his mental condition. Stan Lee was such a progressive guy and Moon Knight was the first character to have the DID condition. Khonshu was also a cool part in which it was also a little ambiguous if he really existed (at least in the earlier ones) perhaps he is really talking to the moon or maybe he's just a schizophrenic.

Villain: This was a harder choice but I finally settled on Carnage. Carnage was a villain with absolutely no moral limitations. He once murdered a man because his name sounded dumb. Carnages design was always so great. The red and black really made him threatening. The bond between the symbiote and Cletus was also interesting as Carnage doesn't refer to himself as ""we"" (like Venom does) but rather as ""I"" because Cletus and Carnage are such a perfect match. Don't get me wrong, Venom is awesome but Carnage one ups him (in my opinion) by not really ever turning good like Venom does, he's always a villain and a threat for Spider-Man.

Can't wait to see what you guys have to say",Marvel,"I'm sure this question has been asked multiple times here but, I'm interested anyway. What Is Your Favorite Marvel Hero and Villain?"
Film/Television,False,Cuz I feel like not ALL characters need to have a comic accurate suit or even have a suit at all. It's ok for some to have a realistic look/outfit to them. I doubt all these characters are ALWAYS gonna get in their tacky armors every time they go on their mission/adventures.,Marvel,What are your opinion on comic accurate suits in the movies?

It only screeched like it was some kind of animal and was really attached to Cletus.

Comics ,False,"I got a lot of comics which mainly focus on the Green Goblin (Norman) and Norman himself after searching the web all over the place.  
The Green Goblins design was great and i liked that he was such a petty sadistic jerk to Spiderman but appearently it didn't really last long?  


He had some comic appearances in the 70's comics where he basically just a ""im evil so i bad things whuahaha"" villian like most back then and didn't really have his own personality much, but then he ""died"" after Gwens death and came back in the early 1990's but it only lasted like 3 issues until Norman stopped being the Green Goblin for loads of issues/years to clear his name until Revenge of the Green Goblin (3 issues) and then nothing until the mid 2000's?  


I'm honestly kinda dissapointed that he (Norman as Green Goblin) is barely even in the comics while he is used in so much (games, movies, promotions etc) making me think he is the ultimate Spider-man villian and the Reverse Flash of the Marvel universe but he basically stopped being Green Goblin in the early 90's.  


Am i wrong? Will he eventually become the Green Goblin again in the mid 2000's? If so, which story arc?

Other,False,"I love how Marvel tends to acknowledge every (or almost every) aspect of a characters past/past runs throughout their stories, but it confuses me to no end on how time works in the comics.

I know supers and supernatural characters will age differently depending on their powerset. Then you have characters like Daredevil and Moon Knight who (for the most part) don't have powers and for all intents and purposes are just normal humans referencing things from the 80s where they were already 20-30 years old and still look around the same age in modern issues when they should be pushing 60-80 years old.

Comics ,False,"So after not following Marvel for years since Secret Wars, I'm finally diving into the ANAD era now that controversy from it has settled. Just got done with Civil War II. I'm digging most of what I'm reading right now, although a lot of feels very sanitized/safe compared to the Bendis era and even Marvel NOW.

 I have to say though, Nick Spencer's Sam Wilson is one of the few I'm not feeling right now. During Remender's brief stint, I really enjoyed what I was getting out of the run, and it felt like a book that was just trying to be fun for the most part. I expected Spencer's to go deeper politically as that is in line with what the company was trying to push during that era, and just how media has been for the last several years. I don't mind this per say, but I was hoping to get more value out of it. I don't find his viewpoints to be particularly enlightening or nuanced, and its very much ""in your face"" with its messaging. Very wordy, almost like its masquerading as intellectual without really saying much. I think it was very obvious with how stereotypical/one sided the villains were being portrayed as, and the only one so far I've encountered with any sort of depth to him is John Walker/US Agent, and that was very short lived. 

What are your guys' thoughts on this run without going too deep into the latter half as I've yet to read Secret Empire. I gotta clarify, I don't hate or even dislike it much, I would say I'm firmly in the middle and very much neutral if anything, although I will say I dig the consistent art and the fun moments like Wolf Cap, but thats really it.",Marvel,"Finally reading Nick Spencer's Sam Wilson run, some thoughts."

Film/Television,False,"**PLEASE NO SPOILERS FOR ANYTHING AFTER IRON MAN 3** 

I saw on Rotten Tomatoes that Iron Man 3 is scored higher than Iron Man 2 and generally was liked by critics. 

Am I the only one who thought 3 was worse than 1 and 2? Obviously everyone has different opinions but man, I just wasn’t a huge fan of this film. 

Aldrich Killian just wasn’t a good villain in my opinion. I don’t read the comics so maybe he has another name besides Killian but idk, a generic good looking white dude as the villain? I just wasn’t about that at all. The whole regeneration of limbs + fire skin thing just didn’t do it for me at all. Maybe I’m old school but I love movies with a clear villain who you’re genuinely terrified of. Best example of this for me was the Joker in The Dark Knight. 

That said, Sir Ben Kingsley was hilarious in the movie. 

And another thing - I get this was more of a Tony Stark over Iron Man movie but come on man… it’s called Iron Man 3 not Tony Stark 3. Not enough scenes of Iron Man absolutely crushing it. Reminds me of Star Wars when you’re just waiting to see Luke be a complete badass using all of his powers. We didn’t get that until the Mandalorian, and that was one of the best scenes in the whole Star Wars universe. 

In the third movie of a superhero franchise, I really would love to see the superhero in all his glory. His powers are upgraded and his villain is too. I just didn’t see that here. Seemed like the Iron Man suits were being taken down wayyyyy too easy by henchmen. 

I mean, ffs, Iron Man’s suit holds up against those lightsaber whips, Thor’s hammer, but they do easily go down for this fire asshole’s henchmen? Seemed like a big lapse in consistency. 

And lastly, I get why they wanted Pepper to be the hero but it just didn’t sit well with me. Putting on an arm of the iron man suit doesn’t suddenly give you athleticism. And once she gets a piece of the arm, she turns into black widow all of a sudden? There’s not one hint that Pepper is capable of anything like that. If it’s based on a comic, at least sprinkle some hints in there to let the audience know she actually has some more skills besides her intelligence or compassion. 

While there were enjoyable parts of the movie, I liked the other two WAY more. Iron Man 1 is the best of the bunch, imo, and there’s a big fall off between 2 and 3. 

Overall, loving the MCU. Avengers 1 was sick I can’t wait to watch the rest!",Marvel,I’m just getting into the MCU - is the overall opinion of fans that Iron Man 3 is better than Iron Man 2?

Comics ,False,"Basically starting at page five, after Power Pack saves Jane from a dog, she reveals to them she ran away because her dad ""makes me take my clothes off"" and ""touches me in my private places"".

Jane had told her mother first, and instead of contacting the police ""she told my father and he said I was lying, and then they started arguing again!""

Julie Power (Lightspeed) seems to have the closest relationship with Jane since she's the one who goes up to her and puts her arm around her to steady her when she's wobbly after the dog attack (the boys and Katie stay back). She does most of the talking w/ Jane.

Page six she encourages Jane to tell a grown-up, with one of the boys suggesting their mom (Margaret) saying ""I know she'll believe you"". Julie intelligently adds ""and if she doesn't, we'll help you find someone who will.""

Page SEVEN has Jane tell Margaret some of the details (though not quite as specific as she was with the Power Pack) : ""my dad's been touching me in ways that make me uncomfortable and mixed up"" (nothing about taking clothes off or touching privates, though I'm guessing Margaret intuited it might be something like this)

This is when it gets a bit squick-adjacent. You see Margaret kneel down and hold Jane by her elbows. Now I realize squatting down (Margaret's head is lower than Jane's, she's looking up at her) is probably done to appear less intimidating, and she's probably holding Jane's arms with the intent of reassuring/bonding with her, but for someone who's been suffering physical abuse, isn't it possible a bad idea (trigger?) to grab them like that?

Especially since... I realize Margaret is pretty athletic, but it's pretty hard to keep your balance in a deep squat like that which inevitably means to keep your balance you're going to push/pull on whatever your hands are grabbing. The better your balance/athleticism the less this happens, but it still seems like a bad idea where the slightest increase in pressure could trigger a traumatized child.

Margaret then says ""I believe you and I'll help"" and does a close hug with Jane, reaching both arms around her: Margaret's left palm is on Jane's left lattisimus while her right palm is cupping Jane's left ear.

Jane has her face turned to the left with her eyes closed. She seems to be returning the hug, with her arms around Margaret's waste.

Page EIGHT is where we see Jim (who just arrived at end of pg 7) talking to Margaret in the living room after Margaret called him in there. You see that Jane is upset at the prospect of Margaret telling Jim (""she's telling him, isn't she?""). Was this okay to do? Seems like maybe Margaret could've asked permission before sharing the information with her husband.

There is a ""and soon"" fast-forward where you see Margaret putting down the phone, saying she just called Jane's mom (Lois) a 2nd time. There is no indication here that Margaret called the police first, or that Margaret asked Jane's permission to call her mother.

Jane had told Margaret earlier ""my mom won't believe it"" which should indicate she might be a co-abuser, that maybe contacting her instead of the police would be a bad idea.

I think Jane probably experienced a betrayal of confidence earlier with her mom. Lois immediately begins ripping into Jane's dad, no indication she asked permission of Jane first to confront the dad in person... Jane clearly dislikes her parent's altercations which probably make her afraid of violence: maybe Jane would prefer if Lois contacted the police instead of trying to settle it herself?

Jane might be getting flashbacks of that the way that Margaret just immediately goes and talks to Jim about it before asking. It's really contrast with the way the Power Pack respect Jane's agency. Jane only reveals the abuse to Julie Power in the first place because Jane promises ""you have our word"" when asked ""do you swear you won't tell anyone else?""

Julie respects that confidence: instead of immediately going ""welp, running off to tell a grownup now"" (ie shattering Julie's trust in Jane's honesty, impeding her ability to help her as a confidant in the future) Julie pleads with Jane until she agrees, keeping their trust intact.

I guess that brings up ""what if Julie couldn't convince Jane"" scenario of how to resolve: like should they eventually break their word and tell someone (police or parents) or find some other way to resolve the scenario? Being superheroes they could have probably done a 'deus ex machina' intervention like ""appear as a ghost warning Jane's dad he'll be pulled into hell by demons if he doesn't confess to his crimes and go to prison"" but what if that didn't work?

- -

Anyway getting back to page 8, there's a 2nd element in the second panel I want to focus on too. The left is Margaret hanging up the phone revealing she called Lois (Jane's mom) but the right side shows that Jim suddenly has his arm around Jane...

Although we don't know exactly what Margaret told Jim (it's off-camera) if it's basically the insinuations that Jane told Margaret (left out the nudity/privates, just 'uncomfortable touch') then he should probably know enough that since it was an adult man who did this to Jane, having another adult man touch her like that could be especially triggering (even though IMO having Margaret grab her arms could also have triggered)

A 2nd problem with Jim aside from his hugginess (which like Margaret prob had good intentions but seems ill-considered w/o receiving permission to touch first) is his advice... He isn't proposing calling the police or Child Protective Services... instead it's a vague ""number where families like yours can find help"".

I don't really know what this means, but I'm not sure it refers to the proper channels. It sounds like he's saying ""you and your mom and dad can get together and call this number together"". But what if Jane tried that and her dad flipped out and murdered her?

It really seems like the police or CPS would be the ones to call about this, so maybe he's referring to that, it's just hard to tell.

Also we do see Jim pick up the phone himself in the 2nd-last panel, so it seems to be implied that he's going to phone that number and pass it over so that Jane can speak in private to this counseling service (whatever it is) from the safety of the Power household, so that's probably a good thing.

In thinking about how Jane felt about others holding him, I think the last panel is a great thing to contrast. When Julie hugs her frmo the left side, Jane is smiling. But when Margaret and Jim hugged her, she is not smiling. I guess part of that is context (in the final panel Jane probably feels more sure of herself)

I think that's because Jane and Julie have a close relationship where there's mutually implied consent to hug each other in situations like this, consent which probably was not established or implied with Julie's mother and father hugging Jane.

- -

The accompanying Spider-Man story ""Secrets"" seems to have a similar problem too. When Tony Lewis confides in Spider-Man about his babysitter Judy (""she started to touch me, that's when you showed up"") instead of contacting police, Spider-Man asks Tony if he can talk to his parents. In fairness to Spidey, it's not like he's throwing the problem in their lap though, he's there to observe their reactions and if he thought something was fishy (like they wouldn't help) he could've acted then.

It's weird though, after being told by Tony how Judy touched him without permission, you see Spider-Man use his left hand to palm Tony's right shoulder, saying ""hang on tight Tony!"" Spidey doesn't ask ""would you like me to websling you across town while holding you in my arms"" or anything like that first, just seems to assume Tony would be okay with it and grabs him.

You'd think with the story that Peter just related about Skip fresh on his mind that he would be more sensitive about that type of thing. Even though he confided in Ben+May about what happened, he could've had PTSD where he shuddered away from adult affection (particularly from his uncle) and should know this could be a possibility with Ben having PTSD from Judy's touching. Even though Spider-Man is male, you could still have an overall paranoia of touch after something like this.

Does anyone know if Marvel did any other anti-CSA comics after this double-feature in 1984? Wondering if any subsequent attempts to revisit the issue showed a bit more tact. I realize that probably the writers didn't know as much in the early 80s when this was written so judging it by today's standards 38 years later is a bit unfair, but it seems like an issue which could use an update.

Maybe they could even bring back the characters of Tony Lewis and Jane (maybe even give her a surname?) and aside from updating the interactions to more modern sensibilities, follow the stories further so we can see the ramifications of what happens, maybe even put together a larger plot-arc where eventually Jane and Tony meet and help PP+PP fight an appropriate supervillain?",Marvel,"September 1984: rereading the Power Pack story ""Runaway"" could Jim and Marge have acted better regarding Jane?"

Film/Television,False,"So, I think everyone knows by now that Doctor Strange In the Multiverse of Madness looks freaking awesome, and the trailer was really great too. It didn't show too much while still giving us an idea of what the movies about, that being Strange needing to repair the Multiverse after the events of NWH, while also stopping a mysterious evil force from destroying everything, the tone, structure, and Atmosphere feels very much like Cosmic and Gothic Horror film, on top of having Raimi signature style, The soundtrack they used was very well done, it looks like it'll be as trippy and crazy with the visuals, just as much if not more so then the first film, and overall the film looks and sounds like it's going to be something special and epic.

But I wanted to focus on my predictions for What the general premise will be. Well, okay we know what that will be, Strange having to repair the Multiverse, but I want to focus on the role of America Chavez in the film. America Chavez is going to be making her on screen, MCU debut in this film, and it seems like she will have a huge part to play with her creating star Portals and travelling the Multiverse with Strange and all that. However we also see a lot of creatures and such going after Strange, this leads me to my prediction.

While I believe the main plot will be Strange having to repair both the Multiverse and his world from destruction (the trailers showed New York in a similar world ending position to what we saw in Episode 4 of What If...?) After tampering with the Multiverse when he attempted the spell to erase Peters memory, but I think it will have a Subplot, that subplot in question will be protecting America Chavez, due to her being the key to restoring the Multiverse and everyone wanting her for there own reasons. You have Strange protecting her and getting her helping in saving everything, but we also have seen Mordo in the trailer, who, if he is continuing his crusade of killing all sorcerers and removing spells and healing caused by sorcerers, then he could be going after her to kill Chavez due to his believes that ""There are too many Sorcerers in the universe"" or I guess in this case, Multiverse.

We also see Stephen Strange Supereme in the trailers, with the trailer sort of implying he will be the main villain, now this is obviously a misdirect, not that he won't be a villain, I do think he will be a threat to Doctor Strange In the film, because why market it as Strange fighting an evil version of himself if it's not what the film is going to be, the real misdirect is that he won't be the Main villain of the film, I do think he will be a secondary antagonist, or a red herring villain until the true main antagonist is revealed in the third act (I'll talk about who I think that will be later) but I don't think he's going to be the main villain of the film. 

Or maybe the trailers aren't lying and Strange Supereme really I the main antagonist of the film, idk, i mean we see Wong being restrained by magic that looks similar to Stephen's Magic and a light shining on Wongs face so maybe Stephen Strange Supereme is the big bad, though it would weird if that's the case, since they'd be playing there cards pretty early, but then again Wandavision played there cards when it was revealed was Behind everything, so idk anymore (like I said though, I'll talk who I think the true main antagonist could be if not him later). 

But I do think he could be going after Chavez in order to use her in one last attempt to bring back his Christine, which I think him finding out about Chavez and her power would be a good explanation for why Strange Supereme has seemingly relapsed and has become Evil again. But those two won't be only ones going after her. In the trailer we also see Wanda is going to have a big role, the trailers market it as if she will be an ally for a majority of the film, and while I think that could be the case, it's also possible they could be hiding certain thing about in the role in the film. There are rumors that Wanda may actually be the main Antagonist of the film, now I don't think there entirely true, I personally think Wanda will have a similar role to what Tony had in Civil War. 

Where, shes not a villain persay, but her goals and motivations don't align with Doctor Strange and it leads to conflict, that conflict would be Wanda maybe wanting to use Chavez to try and find her children, perhaps she will even rip through the Multiverse to go after Strange and Chavez. Also earlier in the trailer we see a shot of Wanda doing her magic trick with her hands, and behind her is a portal that looks to be the door way the TVA used. Implying that they maybe going after Wanda for something, perhaps for ripping through the Multiverse, but it's also possible they could also be going after Chavez, due to them seeing her as a threat to the now damaged Sacred Timeline (this is also how 2012 Loki could play a part in some way if he is in the film, with him trying to also protect Chavez from the TVA).

But now to talk about what I think the true main antagonist is going to be (if it's not actually going to be Wanda or Strange Supereme), in the trailer we see none other then what looks to be Gargantos fighting Stephen in the streets of New York, this leads me to believe that Shuma-Gorath is the true main antagonist of the film, and the one truly pulling the strings in his endeavor, with him sending Gargantos to try and deal with the Sorcerer Supereme, and after that presumably fails, he instead manipulates Wanda and Strange Supereme into doing his bidding, without either one knowing it. I personally think he would be pretty good as an antagonist of this film, and him being yhe true puppet master would make for a pretty dramatic reveal and epic finale. But why would he want to stop Strange from repairing the Multiverse and why would he want Chavez? I don't really know, maybe it could be that with He Who Remains now dead he wants to rebuild the Multiverse in his own image maybe? And Chavez may get in the way of that?

In conclusion I personally think the main plot will be repairing the Multiverse and the main MCU, which the subplot will be everyone wanting Chavez and Strange having to protect her, with Mordo wanting to kill, Wanda wanting to use her to find her children, The TVA possibly wanting to Prune both her and Wanda due to them seeing both of them as a threat, Strange Supereme wanting to her to try one last time to bring back his Christine, and Shuma Gorath using both Wanda and Strange Supereme as his unknowing Servants (as well as Gargantos at the beginning of the film) to either kill her because she may get in the way of his plans, or use to advanced his plans in someway. But there is one more thing I want to mention before I close off. The themes and message of the film.

With Raimi being involved I feel there may be some sort of heavy theme and message throughout the film, his Spiderman trilogy is proof of that, and I think the message of the film will be learning to move on. This is hinted at the trailer, we see the glass of the watch Christine gave Stephen in the first movie shattered, which is also meant to represent the stat of the main timeline and the Multiverse as a whole, but it could also represent the fracture relationship between Stephen and Christine, also a lot of things have changed since Stephen got snapped and blipped back, Wong is now Sorcerer Supereme and in the trailer we see Christine going to get to someone else. 

On top of that we also see other characters whom are unwilling to move on, we see Mordo, who is unwilling to move on from his quest and the fact that The Ancient One pulled magic from the Dark Dimension, we see Wanda who, despite everything she went through in Wandavision is unwilling to move on from the lose of her children judging by the end credits scene of the series finale for Wandavision, We see Strange Supereme Relapsing (or at least that's what's implied) and still unwilling to move on from the death Christine, and we see hints to the TVA whom despite the Multiverse returning are unwilling to accept that and trying to restore the Sacred Timeline, as seen in the finale of Loki Season 1 there are TVA members going through Portals to prune timelines despite the fact there's no real point in doing that. We could even see 2012 Loki go through something similar with him unwilling to move on from Sylvie, if he is even in the film of course.

I think we will see our main Strange (God it feels really weird and awkward saying that) struggling with this, struggling to move on from his former life, struggling to move on Christine and the fact that someone else is Sorcerer Supereme, and struggling to move on from the fact he can restore the Time Stone (the reason say that is that the official summary mentions Strange looking into stuff involving the time stone, so maybe he is trying to restore it in some way) and in the end tho, Stephen may have to learn to accept the fact he can't have all of it back, he can't keep looking into past, and has to progress beyond, and focus on the future, and how he can make the most out of his new post-Endgame life, yes we will see go to the darker side, as the trailer shows him using Chaos Magic, but in the end he will learn to, while still acknowledging his past and not letting it completely die (Insert Star Wars joke here) he must ultimately move on from it, and look into the future. Which I think would be an excellent arc to have, especially for a movie like this....well that and seeing the craziness of the Multiverse, obviously.

Also I hope we get a recreation of that comic panel where Strange, Wanda, and Loki are all fighting side by side.


TL;DR: The trailer looks sick, i the almost Horror like Gothic and Cosmic Atmosphere it gives off as well as that it doesn't show too much and I can't wait. Also the Main plot I think will be repairing the Multiverse after NWH, while the subplot is protecting America Chavez from everyone in whats basically Bioshock Infinite meets Logan meets a Multiversal version of The Fugitive (and yes those two I could think of as examples) with Shuma Gorath as the true main villain, Wanda (possibly) and Strange Supereme acting as obstacles towards Strange, and the main theme Being learning to move on. Also we better get Strange, Wanda, and Loki fighting side by side like in the comics.",Marvel,"My thoughts on the Multiverse of Madness Trailer, and my predictions for the film."

Film/Television,False,"With the recent trailer of Moonknight coming out, something about it intrigued me. First of all I was blown away by the look and feel of it, but what caught my attention was when Marc started talking about how he suffers from a sleeping disorder along with the quote ""I can't tell the difference between my waking life and dreams"", that line really hit close to home for me. Recently I've been suffering from three illnesses, severe social anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder. The nights for me have been horrible, I can't really sleep well, my dreams convince me that bad things have happened in the real world and my waking life seems like a nightmare sometimes, there's no escape for me and it's the first time in my life I've been scared for myself, I just feel so lost. A couple nights ago I had a panic attack in my sleep and I was convinced that I was going to die, every car that passes my window, every little sound, every little noise in my house, all of it terrified me beyond belief and I thought something bad was going to happen to me, I felt like I was losing my mind, and losing my mind scares me, but I'm trying to recover it, so hopefully I can regain my humanity. Now, on to what I was waking about, this show definitely has a style to it and it's making it clear that the characters mental illness is going to be playing a huge part in it, and that's what intrigued me about this show and character. For years I've noticed the lack of social awareness for those suffering from mental illnesses, me being one of those people, and it's hurt because whenever people have a loved one suffering they don't know how to help them and that causes problems sadly, so for a while it's disappointed me with the lack of representation for the mentally ill. There are films out there that do deal with certain mental disorders such as Requiem for a dream, Black Swan, Shutter Island, the king of Staten island, Jacobs Ladder, and even Iron Man 3 to name a few, but none of these films have reached the level of popularity that any marvel studios property has (I know I named Iron Man 3 and yes that's a marvel studios film but it's not AS popular as some of the recent titles that have come out), and that's why I'm glad that this show being a marvel studios production and having a comic character attached to it will finally give people the opportunity to see what a mentally ill person's life is like, to help them gain perspective on these situations and possibly look into these disorders so that they can help the mental health community and possibly save lives. The last time a comic film did this was Joker (2019) and that showed off its topic with pure success, it was critically acclaimed and financially successful by everyone, Joaquin Phoenix even won an Oscar for crying out loud, and when all that happened it gave me hope that we would be seen. Fast forward three years later and here we are with Moonknight and so far it's looking phenomenal, hopefully it will give more people perspective on what the mentally ill community goes through on an almost daily basis. A fun fact about the song featured in the Moonknight trailer, that song is actually about a psychologically strained individual who's life seems to be turning upside down as everyday goes on, and the only way he can escape it is by smoking marijuana, hence why in the song he calls himself ""The lonely stoner"", the song is called Day N Nite and it's by Kid Cudi, so this song plays more into the trailer than you think and I think it was a very creative decision that someone chose that song for this character.

So most of the ninjas' powers develop genetically. When the X-Men have children their traits get passed down, too.

In Naruto there are some people who believe in war and control, while others think Ninjas' should help each other and strive for peace.

Apparently the X-Men mutated because of extraterrestrial beings. The ninjas also got powers because of an extraterrestrial being.

So in Loki we see Marvels adaptation of Free Will vs Determinism. Given that the TVA protects the “sacred timeline” it suggests that there is no free will and that every choice and action is predetermined and must happen or the TVA will step in and prune the branched timeline. 

So my problem with this is that it means Endgame in particular loses the weight of the decisions made.

When Tony snaps and sacrifices himself it’s NOT his own choice, its predetermined. If he chose not sacrifice himself the TVA would step in.

Title pretty much says it all, I'm having trouble finding even a slither of dialogue that touches on this, but I was hoping anyone knew a reason that no one changed after the T-Bomb?

Not just that, but many NuHumans were revealed, and as the cloud was shown and has been said to have pretty much engulfed the Earth entirely, how didn't a single Inhuman or NuHuman  come into contact with it a second time?

Sand is just rock right? So if sandman grew proportionally, could he not just consume rock as at the point, it's basically just sand?

Even Flash said that everyone in college expected that Peter would go far and win Nobel prizes and instead he's stuck in a dead end job even though he can easily do better.

It would be different if it was a story about some hard luck street kid who grew up in the wrong part of town, with little education and few prospects, struggling to make it out, but that's not what this is at all. 

Peter has had multiple opportunities in his work life as well as his personal life and he's pissed them all away. He could have been a famous scientist but he never got his Ph.D because he was too busy being Spider-Man to get his life in order. MJ put up with more shit to be with him than any woman would have, and he still couldn't make his marriage work.

And because he never admits the problem, he can never work on himself to fix it.

And don't give me that bullshit about how every time he's knocked down he rises back up. Stuck in some dead end job, or no job, with no money, no prospects, no relationships and no savings is not my idea of ""rising back up.""

Set aside that they are from different ""ownerships"" (Sony, Disney (marvel)).

Most studios would have thought that comic book stories are junk. You had the original batman series and you also had the original superman series back in the day. They were fun representations of fantasy.

With Sam, he literally made Spiderman into a super hit, I don't think many people would believe it was possible to make a story with (toby) into a real-life character we could all relate too.

Christopher took it to a new level in realism and made it as close to reality as possible with a bit of spin. He brought this idea of how people could really face this one day.

For Jon but he brought this into a sense of reality that made other characters possible. I don't know if he drew from those folks but he managed to take something like Iron-Man and make it a reality.

As  with the movie Eternals, the idea that the more humanity evolves, the more Celestial seed grows and that super powered people act as antibodies to protect the seed growing inside the Earth. 

While, it’s not as good as Kingdom Come, as Earth X is Marvel’s answer to it, it is still a great set of 36 issues overall.

Film/Television,False,"Ah, Hank Pym, Marvel’s black sheep. Nowadays, the writers are more or less embarrassed by his character, and this has become a more recurring decision as what to do with Pym’s character. Even the MCU opted the other route, to simply skim past all the comic drama that the writers created ago, and transform Hank into an aged mentor for Scott Lang, and with the creative “decision” to have Hank not be a founding member of the Avengers or the Creator of Ultron.

Even though it was for the best, I personally was disappointed by the change, and not because “Scott was the more relatable protagonist”, but because they weren’t willing to give Hank’s character another chance, as if his character was tainted with what he did in the comics.

And I’m not excusing any of the character’s actions in the comics, but I am saying that the real reason Hank’ personality is so messed up is because the writers can’t decide whether Pym is a good guy, a conflicted scientist, a arrogant know-it-all, or a troubled superhero with a bipolar disorder.

Watching EMH made me realize that the reason that version of Hank was the best one was because not only were the writers the same and consistent, but they were willing to give Hank’s comic story a do-over a second chance, probably the last one we’ll ever see. He was a scientist, superhero, and pacifist who wanted to help people but circumstances keep pushing him to go against what he believes in. Even the avengers, his friends and teammates took him for granted and didn't appreciate him for who he is.

Between that and the avengers berating Hank for his pacifism, it's no wonder he snapped and quit. Hank was in the right to quit, and all Janet (The Wasp) could think about was how she didn't want him to quit rather than see Hank's side of things. Even when Hank Pym became yellowjacket, she only wanted him back on the team for her own sake, not even considering Hank or how he feels. It's such a shame that the series ended with Hank still having a severely deteriorated psyche and his issues not fully resolved which is pretty rare to see a pacifist superhero turning into a rude anti-hero.

Should a season 3 of EMH come to pass, and some of us are still praying cand still be a possibility, it would be nice to see Hank get to a more healthy space but still realize that his preferred approach will not always be an option, some people just want to lash out and be violent regardless of help they get.

Spider-Man and Batman are my favorite heroes but EMH version of Hank Pym is a character that ended up relating to deeply, and I don't use that term a lot with Super Heroes.",Marvel,Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes made me Love the character of Hank Pym and it's depressing how Marvel Comics is handling him

He's just a beautiful character design wise (both the Cape version and the suit one)

My friend saw a TikTok about an extremely powerful character but he can't recall his name.

The character is the only superpowered character in his universe.

Apparently they lure him into their universe and trap him. His evil future self comes back in time and frees him. After freeing his past self, he captures Dr. Doom, makes him his disciple and starts destroying universes. 
Next, the future version attempts to destroy a universe but his past attempts to stop him.
Both versions fight, the future versions kills the past version but Dr Doom kills the now weakened future version.

And so i did, I'm reading through it and enjoying it pretty much, is a really nice story even if i find the artstyle to be disgustingly ugly, but this is comment is rather unnecessary.

I had read the full Ditko run a long time ago, so it's been fun to reread that and then see the Romita stuff. I figure I'll keep going until at least the arc with Harry as the Green Goblin. 

One of the key characteristics of Spider-man in these early days is the sense of progression. The big example is that he graduates from high school 30 issues in, but there's a bunch of little ways that the character continues to evolve. There's something very ""pure,"" for lack of a better word, about this evolution of the character that is in direct contrast to where he is in the comics now. I'm not saying that I think all Spider-man comics after a certain year are bad or anything, but there is a sense to me that comics now tend to feel like they are trying to ""play the hits,"" so to speak, and keep the IP going. 

Anyways, I am curious as to when reddit thinks Spider-man shifted to a more 'franchise'-esque character? The options that immediately come to my mind are:

1) When Ditko leaves (ASM #38)

2) When Stan Lee stops being the main writer (ASM #104)

3) When Stan Lee stops editing

4) The first Clone saga (in response to fan outcry over Gwen Stacy's death)

Comics ,False,"# In the Beginning (1975-1979)

Moon Knight first appears as a villain tracking down the Werewolf by Night, and then gets a bunch of guest appearances and a few solo short-stories before he gets his own series.

* Werewolf by Night (1972) #32-33
* Marvel Spotlight (1971) #28-29
* Defenders #47-50 (a little bit of #51 as well)
* The Spectacular Spider-Man (1976) #22-23
* Marvel Two-In-One (1974) #52
* The Hulk \[Magazine\] (1978) #11-15, 17-18, &amp; 20
* Marvel Preview (1975) #21

These are reprinted in **Moon Knight Epic Collection 1: Bad Moon Rising** (may be out of print) and in the upcoming **Moon Knight Omnibus volume 1** coming in February.

# Moon Knight by Doug Moench and Bill Sienkiewicz (1980-1984)

Highly recommended reading. The original 38 issue Moon Knight series almost entirely written by Doug Moench mostly with art by Bill Sienkiewicz is the definitive place to start.

* Moon Knight #1-12
* Marvel Team-Up Annual #4
* Moon Knight #13-16
* *Amazing Spider-Man #220* 
* Moon Knight #17-23
* *Iron Man #161 (team-up with Iron Man)*
* Moon Knight #24-25
* *Power Man and Iron Fist #87 (and a small cameo in #88)*
* Moon Knight #26-38

Most of these are reprinted in **Moon Knight Epic Collection 1: Bad Moon Rising, Moon Knight Epic Collection 2: Shadows of the Moon** and **Moon Knight Epic Collection 3: Final Rest.**

The February release of **Moon Knight Omnibus volume 1** will collect half of this, and the May release of **Moon Knight Omnibus volume 2** will collect the second half and more.

# Moon Knight: Fist of Khonsu and beyond (1985-1989)

These were a bunch of short stories and one miniseries that shook things up for Moon Knight.

* Marvel Team-Up #144  - A team-up with Spidey. (1984)
* Moon Knight (1985) #1-6 - The Fist of Khonshu miniseries that introduced the idea of Moon Knight's different identities being alternate personalities.  (1985)
* Marvel Fanfare (1982) #30 and #38-39 - Three solo adventures with Moon Knight by different creative teams. (1987-1988)
* Solo Avengers #3 (1988)
* Marvel Super-Heroes #1 (1990) had a story originally meant to be printed earlier.

The upcoming **Moon Knight Omnibus volume 2** will reprint these.

# Moon Knight: West Coast Avenger (1987-1989)

Moon Knight joined the West Coast Avengers. This was an odd fit, but writer Steve Englehart tried to make him part of the more quirky West Coast team. Once Englehart left, Moon Knight did too.

* West Coast Avengers #21-24
* West Coast Avengers Annual #2
* Avengers Annual #15
* West Coast Avengers #25-37
* West Coast Avengers Annual #3 (short story back-up)
* West Coast Avengers #39-41

Sadly, the way the volumes are printed, you can't easily just get his chunk on the team in one collection. That's **Avengers West Coast Epic Collection 2: Lost in Space-Time** (most of which is before Moon Knight joins the team), then **Avengers West Coast Epic Collection 3: Tales to Astonish**  and **Avengers West Coast Epic Collection 4: Vision Quest** (most of volume 4 is after Moon Knight leaves the team when new writer John Byrne takes over)

# Marc Spector: Moon Knight (1989-1994)

A new Moon Knight ongoing series began. It, and most of his appearances in this era are pretty much entirely out of print and have never been reprinted.

* Marc Spector: Moon Knight #8-14
* Moon Knight: Divided We Fall (Marvel Graphic Novel #58)
* Marc Spector: Moon Knight #15-33

* Marc Spector: Moon Knight Special (1992) #1 - a one-shot.
* Marc Spector: Moon Knight #35-40
* Moon Knight: Divided We Fall (1992) #1- Another one-shot.
* Marc Spector: Moon Knight #41-43 - Infinity War crossover tie-ins
* Web of Spider-Man #93-94 was another team-up with Spider-Man.
* Marc Spector: Moon Knight #44-60

After the end of that series, we got a short story by previous Moon Knight writer Chuck Dixon in the Marvel Comics Presents anthology, set in the past.

* Marvel Comics Presents #151-154

# The Moon Knight Returns (1998-1999)

Original creator Doug Moench returns and does two four issue miniseries. They are not collected anywhere.

* Moon Knight (1998) #1-4 - ""Resurrection Wars""
* Moon Knight (1999) #1-4 - ""High Strangeness""

# Moon Knight Team-Ups (2000-2003)

He then appears in the short-lived ""Marvel Knights"" team in issues #4-14 with other street level Marvel heroes .

The entire run of that team is collected in **Marvel Knights by Dixon &amp; Barreto: Defenders of the Streets**.

He also shows up in a storyline in Marvel Team-Up, but mostly in issue 7, and a bit at the finale. It was meh.

# Heroic Age: Moon Knight by Brian Bendis and Alex Maleev (2011-2012)

Bendis does a controversial re-imagining of Moon Knight, where his alternate personalities are Spider-Man, Captain America and Wolverine, in what is very clearly an attempt to boost sales.

# Marvel Legacy: Moon Knight (2017-2018)

As part of the ""Marvel Legacy"" push, what would have been issue 15 of the previous run instead was #188 with a new creative team, adding up the numbers of all the previous Moon Knight comics before it. Writer Max Bemis takes over, with most issues drawn by Jacen Burrows.

* Moon Knight #188-200

These were collected as **Moon Knight: Legacy Vol. 1: Crazy Runs in the Family** and **Moon Knight: Legacy Vol. 2: Phases** with a rerelease as a single volume scheduled for this May as **Moon Knight: Legacy - The Complete Collection**.

# Moon Knight Crossovers (2019-2020)

Moon Knight was then part of the ""Acts of Evil"" crossover.

Film/Television,False,"*no spoilers. Just background info.

Hey! First off, I am VERY excited for Moon Knight. It is one of my favorite characters, and the trailer indicates the show will be GREAT. However, I have a few problems with the casting and the crew.

Oscar Isaac is an awesome actor– no doubt. He might not Jewish, and I would 120% would prefer Moon Knight's character to be played by a Jewish actor– but it doesn't matter. **I'm glad marvel said they will make Moon Knight both Latino and Jewish, not just make him appear as Ashkenazi Jewish**

HOWEVER, as far as I know (going through IMDB crew list), there is NO Latino actor working on the show. AND, **except Don Perlin,** who worked on the characters' writing/design, **there is no Jewish person working on the show.**

Moon Knight's identity is DEPENDENT on him being jewish and his father being a holocaust survivor– it's a whole part of his lore and why he became Moon Knight and developed Dissociative Identity Disorder.

I have family who ran away to Argentina during the Holocaust, and they are Jewish Latino. I would be more than happy if marvel would've done something like that– it will be good for representation of both Latino AND Jewish community. 

I hope they won't hurt Moon Knight's Jewish identity and Holocaust history, it is so important for his character and for the Jewish community.",Marvel,Problems with Moon Knight (as a Jewish person)
Film/Television,False,Ive always always been fascinated by Spider-Man 2099. I love the whole future angle. Like Batman Beyond.

Film/Television,False,"Years we got Spider-Man traveling to Europe and having an adventure. Now we have 3 Spider-Man and multiple villains from across 20 years of movie history in one movie.  


We also got Doctor Strange fighting back Dormammu. Now we'll get a former friend turn foe, summon an Eldritch Abomination and even an evil Doctor Strange from another universe encounter our Doctor Strange, who will also go to Scarlet Witch for help.  


Ant-Man was fighting Yellowjacket. Now Ant-Man and Wasp will most likely face a mad conqueror, who has devastated multiple universes and I highly expect that we'll get to see fan favorites and have some new characters introduced in that movie.   


And I fucking love it. Every single second of it. I just hope they continue to find the balance and we never ever end up with a Spider-Man 3 again. It feels like all these new movies are filled with characters like Spider-Man 3 was, but somehow everything is paced so much better, since everything we see, we've encountered in prior movies... and had the chance to familiarize ourselves with it.

Film/Television,False,"#Norman Osborn Saved Timeline:

With Green Goblin gone and Norman’s sanity restored, he lives relatively in peace. Due to his crimes as the Green Goblin, he’s  court-ordered to take years of psychiatric treatment at a mental hospital upstate.

Though the information of his father being the Green Goblin &amp; his best friend being Spider-Man shocks Harry to his core, he eventually comes to terms with the events that transpired and his relationship with Peter remains very much intact. 

When Spider-Man 2 rolls around and Dr. Octavius comes looking for Tritium to rebuild his fusion reactor, Harry is forced to give it up at the threat of his own life rather than striking a deal with Octavius to get revenge on Spider-Man. 

He immediately goes to warn Peter what’s about to happen, and Spider-Man goes to stop him from rebuilding the Fusion Reactor, this time stopping him before he completes the Machine fully. 

Though it’s a tough battle, Spider-Man is eventually able to subdue Doc-Oc thanks to not having to worry about Mary Jane or any other bystanders, and discreetly works on a new chip for his robotic arms with Norman Osborn. Though it takes a considerably longer time to do so because Peter Parker lacks the technical hardware, most of the theoretical work is already done since Norman has experience building a chip from his time in No Way Home. Doc Oc is cured, though similarly to Norman he has to take mandatory treatment for the crimes he committed while under the influence of the arms. 

With his compliance, they’re able to safely remove the arms from his spine, and the technology is confiscated.

On a little side note: Seeing as the conversation where Peter Parker broke up with Mary Jane was never interrupted in this timeline, and he didn’t have to rescue her from Doc-Oc, it’s likely their relationship never gets prepared and she actually does go through with marrying John Jonah Jameson III. 

Though Peter is saddened that he lost his chance to be with MJ, her living her own life and not being in Peter’s as much causes him to take more notice of Ursula, the nice daughter of his LandLord. 

When Spider-Man 3 rolls around, Ursula &amp; Peter have been on a few dates and are in that same Web Scene where Venom crash lands and hitches a ride on his bike.

Peter takes Ursula to see MJ’s play with Harry, and though the two are no longer romantically involved Peter &amp; MJ remain good friends. Even JJJ III is starting to get chummy with Peter, and he sort of joins his circle of friends, though he isn’t in on the Spider-Man secret like Harry is and every now and again they’ll get into a little debate on whether or not Spider-Man is a hero or a crazed vigilante. JJJ III doesn’t really let this drive a wedge between them though, as he’s mature enough to recognize that people have different opinions about the webhead. He’s less so against Spider-Man cuz he has his own personal vendetta against him and more so he just buys into the Daily Bugle propaganda his father propagates. After all, he has no reason to disbelieve his father and he was probably on the moon when the first Spider-Man movie happened.


At any rate, Peter gets the ring from Aunt May and ask Mr. Ditkovitch for his blessing to propose to Ursula and Harry doesn’t attack him cuz he’s chill. Flint Marco gets sanded, and then the whole Spider-Man parade happens. 

He kisses Gwen Stacy, Sandman attacks, Spider-Man gets his butt kicked and ponders where all these guys come from. Ursula doesn’t know the Spider-Man secret yet, so she’s not mad about the Gwen Stacy kiss, though Peter eventually pulls his head out of his ass and realizes “Ah, that wasn’t cool.” and shortly before proposing to Ursula he comes clean about everything, being Spider-Man and all. They get into a little argument about it, but Ursula isn’t the type to hold grudges or make drama when she doesn’t have to, so everything’s cool once Peter gives a sincere apology.

Sometime after Peter &amp; Auny May are told that it was Flint Marco, not Dennis Carradine, who ended up killing Uncle Ben. 

Peter is PISSED, and as he’s sleeping through it the venom symbiote latches onto him and he becomes Black Suit Spider-Man.

He kicks Flint Marco’s ass, and then figures he’s dead. There’s nothing really else going on with him that the Symbiote is affecting: Other than that bit with Gwen Stacy, his relationship with Ursula is really good. Harry isn’t trying to kill him and they’re still good friends. 

The only thing that still happens is him calling out Eddie Brock for using Photo-Shop and telling him to accept Jesus Christ as his lord and savior.

So instead of Emotional Trauma causing his decision, (ie, accidentally hurting those closest to him thanks to the Symbiote heightening his aggression) he gets rid of the Symbiote because it nearly makes him bite a dudes head off while out patrolling as Spider-Man and he’s like “Ah Crap this alien hungers for Human Organs.” He gets rid of it at the Bell Tower, it gets stuck at Eddie Brock, he swings home naked and in a daze, and Venom and Sandman team up to take out Spider-Man.

Because Eddie knows Peter’s secret, Venom kidnaps Ursula and brings her to the construction sight. Mr. Ditkovitch puts two and two together and way like “Wait. Green Goblin captured MJ while she was dating that Parker boy. Now this weird alien that has rap music following him wherever he goes has kidnapped my daughter. Both are enemies of Spider-Man. Peter = Spider-Man.” So he wakes up Peter in a mad frenzy and says “Go rescue my daughter or I’ll raise your rent.” And yeah, you know, he goes to rescue her.

But as he arrives, someone comes soaring through the air: Harry, having seen the news, decided to unveil some stuff he had been working on in secret.

Oscorp developed that New Goblin gear he sported in the original timeline, and Harry paid multiple visits to his father &amp; Octavius to ensure his math was right when creating the new Goblin Serum so he wouldn’t go Crai-crai. 

Seeing as Peter wasn’t beaten half to death after being tag teamed and Harry didn’t take a Pumpkin Bomb to the face in this timeline, they’re more prepared to take on Venom &amp; Sandman and finish the fight without a casualty. After Brock gets blown up along with the Venom Symbiote, Sandman chills out, explains what really happened the night Uncle Ben died, and why he resorted to crime in the first place. 

Peter forgives him, and Harry offers to pay for his daughter's treatment so long as he answers for his crimes and does some jail time. He agrees.

New Goblin &amp; Spider-Man form a team, and after Norman finishes his mandatory treatment he regains control of Oscorp and builds himself a suit based off a blueprint he saw in No Way Home: That’s right folks. He builds himself The Iron Patriot Suit. With the help of Octavius, they’re able to build an arc reactor to fuel the suit. Octavius joins the team with his new Robot arms provided by Oscorp, and finally Sand-Man joins them after he serves his sentence, forming that Universe's version of The Avengers.

Also Harry ends up with Gwen Stacy I guess. Maybe JJJ III joins the team after temporarily becoming an antagonist to Spider-Man as either Man-Wolf or Colonel Jupiter.

#Octavius Saved Timeline:

In the original Timeline for Spider-Man II, Octavius gained control of the arms after words of wisdom from Spider-Man, though was likely struggling to keep control after he made his final sacrifice to stop the Fusion Reactor. In this timeline, he has full control, and is able to come up with a plan to drown the Fusion Reactor while all three of them escape with their lives.

Like the GGS timeline, the OS timeline has Octavius get court ordered treatment for an extended period of time and has his arms removed from his spine. Before he does turn himself in though, Octavius gives Peter the recipe for functioning nanotech, and Peter eventually develops a similar suit to the one we see in the Unlimited Spider-Man cartoon.

However, the rest of the timeline plays out normal from here.

#Sandman Saved Timeline:

Sandman loses his powers and gets arrested. His daughter probably dies to whatever illness she had.



#Lizard Saved Timeline:

Given that most of Spider-Man’s villains were transported to the MCU almost right as they found out Peter was Spider-Man, I’ll assume that’s the same for Dr. Conners here. He gets apprehended in the sewers by Spider-Man, Gwen’s father survives(though he doesn’t gain the respect he had for Spider-Man the same way he did when he sacrificed himself to buy Spider-Man time), but the rest of the timeline plays out normally for here. 

Except for one thing. Seeing as Gwen Stacy still dies but Officer Stacy lives, his distaste for Spider-Man’s vigilantism turns into a full on vendetta as(ironically) ha himself turns to Vigilantism to hunt Spider-Man down.



#Electro Saved Timeline:

Electro shows up looking as he did in No Way Home, though no one’s there. He hears a commotion going on inside that one building, and goes to investigate. Just in the Nick of time, he catches Gwen Stacy, and explains everything that transpired.

Peter helps him to learn to control his abilities as he originally intended, and ends up training him to be the New Superhero of New York, as he himself moves to Britain with Gwen Stacy and becomes Spider-Man UK.

Whenever Electro accesses his powers he goes back to that blue look he had, since the yellow energy was from being in the MCU. To regain his human identity, he just has to wait for the device to discharge him.",Marvel,My Take on What Happened to each villain at the end of No Way Home &amp; how that effected Spidey’s Story:

Comics ,False,"I just got done rereading Hickman's Avengers/Secret Wars and I've pretty much achieved my goal of covering most of the Bendis 2000s era and NOW era comics I want to read (barring some street stuff like Spider-Man and Daredevil, reserved for solo read-throughs). I know ANAD era gets a lot of flack, but it feels weird to me to skip over 2.5 years of content just to get to some  of the more interesting titles going on right now. I have bit of continuity OCD when it comes to these things. 

I'm interested in the Avengers titles and will be continuing Aaron's Thor until its finished. I know people crap on Civil War II and Secret Empire, but I do want to try out the Spencer's Cap books. Ultimates and anything by Ewing I read by default. I'll probably give Black Panther a shot as well.

(Applies to all species) Of course, it’s very rare, which is where there aren’t many on Earth. Knull created the first symbiote by being the first man to masturbate!  It all makes sense now.

Webcomics,False,"When I was a kid, I collected Spider-Man comics for a while.  Got into GI Joe and Transformers when I was 10-12.  Batman graphic novels in my teens.  SW Clone Wars in my early 20s.  But I would only buy for a short time and then lost interest (or ran out of spare money).  Several years ago I got a Thor graphic novel - The God Bomb.  Sooo good.  It always made me want to get into more Marvel.  

I’m a fan, but more a movie and video game fan than an actual Marvel comic fan.  To show the depths of my ignorance: at the end of the first Ironman movie, when Fury brought up the Avengers Initiative and my friends lost their minds - I didn’t know what they were talking about.  Sad…I know.

So fellow Marvel fans - where do I begin?  What are some great stories to get into?  I have Thor God of Thunder, Matt Fraction’s Hawkeye, House of M and Miles Morales Spider-Man.

Other,False,"I think if Galactus appears he should be portrayed as an anti-hero of sorts, his backstory is pretty sad when you think about it. He’s the sole survivor of a dead universe, he was a career scientist, a husband and a father and when he sacrificed himself to save his family and his planet he was cursed with eternal life at the cost of taking the lives of billions at a time. 

I think Galactus should be written as a character who if he was to die it would change the universe in an extremely negative way, he should be a necessary evil, he should be portrayed as a character who says something like “if I could choose to starve myself I would, to be rid of this pain and join my family, but I cannot, if I perish the universe would crumble under the weight of the powerful celestials.”

Now I have no idea what his role is gonna be in the MCU but I hope he’s portrayed as a character who really hates being a “villain” and he doesn’t want to do this but it is simply necessary for the survival of the universe, when it comes to his heralds such as Silver Surfer I think he wouldn’t want to burden another with his life of loneliness, despair but Norin Radd works out a deal with Galactus in order to save his planet, and I feel like Galactus wouldn’t have an ego or treat his heralds like servants I feel he would see them as more colleagues and he would treat them with respect and kindness as he regrets the painful job that he is forced to give them in order to survive.

This is just my interpretation of Galactus and I know he’s not like this in the comics but I feel like a character with this kind of backstory wouldn’t be some evil egotistical god like creature who enjoys devouring planets at the cost of billions to protect the universe from celestials, I feel he would spend whatever free time he had mourning his family or just sitting hating himself for the horrible things he is forced to do, I just thought this I was a cool idea and wanted to share it.",Marvel,MCU Galactus

I was working for the last couple of months on an exciting project, creating a complete timeline for the main Marvel Universe (Earth-616) compiling all major comic series to help people follow the timeline while reading.

I’ve looked for similar documents online but couldn’t find one. There are pretty good lists, but they are not inclusive as this one. 

As you will see from the link below, the timeline is still underdeveloped, and I’d say it’s only 35-40% completed. However, I thought of sharing this with you now, to hear your thoughts and ideas on how to improve this. 

Few things to consider below:

\-  The timeline starts with Avengers Disassembled (2004) as starting point.

\-  The titles are displayed in TPB Volumes instead of Chapters, as obviously such timeline won’t work with Chapters format and in fact, I prefer reading in TPB format. 

\-  You will find titles which are highlighted in Green, these are the ones I read so far, I’m keeping track of what I read this way and I think you’ll like to do the same =)

Film/Television,False,"I'm a big story buff when it comes to the media I consume. I never like to be left out of what's going on in a given universe. Unfortunately for me, the MCU, as of late, seems to be a bit muddled given not only the pre-Disney+ shows but also the multiverse. As of now, I've seen all theatrically released MCU films, the various Disney+ series, and, in response to the leaks of no way home, I watched the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield Spider-Man movies along with Sony's Venom movies (I plan to watch Morbius and any future Sony Marvel films since we know them to take place in a universe parallel to the MCU. 

I have two main questions: are the other Marvel shows canon and what should I watch before Multiverse of Madness? As for the first one, King Pin's appearance in Hawkeye and Daredevil's appearance in No Way Home make for good evidence that they are but from what I hear, they aren't definitive proof. If Daredevil was canon, which other shows would I have to watch as a result of crossovers?

I'm kind of screwed when it comes to Multiverse of Madness, I'm kinda screwed based on the name alone. In the trailer, the logo glitched to the Fox logo. Does that mean I need to watch all 13 or so X-Men movies along with the two 2000s Fantastic Four movies? I just want to make sure I'm able to understand everything by the time the movie comes out.

All help is appreciated.",Marvel,What is MCU Canon?

Comics ,False,"Anyone currently reading Radiant Black and are excited for the expansion of the Radiant Black universe in 2022?

&amp;#x200B;

I bought the first issue upon release last year and heavily enjoyed it but I decided to wait a couple of months before picking the book back up again. Around the time issue #5 released I finally got caught up with it and since then I've been fully invested in this book and am super excited for the spin-off titles and expansion of this new ""universe"" of characters in 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

I've long been looking for a cohesive line of comic book titles to jump into since the death of Crossgen comics back in 2004. I really tried to get into the Dark Horse Project Black Sky line of books back around 2013/2014 as well as the Dynamite Entertainment Project Superpowers universe 10+ years ago, but now it appears Radiant Black will be my comic book ""home"". I'm truly excited to see what comes of these books and am hoping this isn't a flash in the pan series that will be wrapped up within the next couple years as I feel there is a market for a true alternative to Marvel/DC.

&amp;#x200B;

So far the sales figures for Radiant Black look good, the interest among the comics community certainly seems to be there, and Image appears to be fully behind the project as well as Kyle Higgins himself. That, in itself, is a great start to what could be a great long-term venture.

Film/Television,False,"Spoilers duh.

So I was thinking how the time travel aspect of this film works.

If Doc Ock got taken away at that moment then how did Tobey Maguire's Spiderman come from the future? Same with all the other spidermen villains.

As we saw in Avengers Endgame time travel doesn't exactly exist. They've all probably made a branch timeline. Meaning our Doc Ock and our Tobey Maguire is now living in slightly altered world's.

Tobey will go back to MJ (in I assume 2024) with the knowledge of the other Spidey's yet Doc Ock will still be dead and doc Ock will go back to the moment he had Peter around the neck (in 2004) but will be a changed man (It would be very confusing for that Peter 🤣). He would then use Iron Man's ark reactor to make the city better as he planned. Same with every other person taken.

Even with Happy,  who knew that Peter was Spiderman thus wouldn't really consider them different people remembers Spiderman and almost seemed to talk about him as though he knew him personally when talking about how he met his aunt. This tells me that people would likely remember Peter while he was Spiderman even of they knew he was Peter at the time, and they would know his personality as Spiderman thus in a way knowing Peter since he was basically his same nerdy self but just as a cool super hero. Could he not just unmask himself to those he is close to since they would think of themselves as friends of Spiderman and resume his friendship in a weird way.

Other,False,"TL;DR - Despite Avengers Campus having better food and costumes for its characters and more connections to the MCU, Super Hero Island is the better Marvel-themed land. Its theming has more personality and its attractions are much more exciting, and Universal’s Spider-Man ride blows Disney’s Web Slingers out of the water.  

I’ve been to both. I live 45 minutes northeast of Disneyland, and I go to Avengers Campus a lot. So I love both, but Super Hero Island is more exciting in my opinion.

I’ll give credit where credit is due though. Pym Test Kitchen is much better than Cafe 4 and the Captain America Diner. Junior high cafeteria meatball sandwiches and hockey puck hamburgers are no match for the creative food at Disney, like the PYM-ini and the not so little chicken sandwich. It’s not the best quick-service restaurant on Disneyland property, but it’s still imaginative themed dining.

Also, the Super Hero Island costumes are laughable compared to the Avengers Campus costumes. They kinda look like pajamas, especially Spider-Man. But, and I’ll get into this later, the cheesiness is part of the charm. Doctor Doom’s costume is an exception though.

Avengers Campus is themed to the MCU, whereas Super Hero Island is themed to the Marvel comics and 90s animated TV series. Walking around the land, it is SO 90s. But that’s why I love it. It has more personality than Avengers Campus.

I didn’t feel like I entered the MCU in Avengers Campus, but I literally felt liked I jumped into a Marvel comic book in Super Hero Island. I love its bright colors and enlarged character artwork. I love how the Auntie Anne’s pretzel stand is just called Pretzels, or how stores are just called Store or Comics. Some might say it’s lazy, but I think that’s part of the fun of it. 

And I’ll address the elephant in the room - the rides. Storm’s Mad Tea Party knockoff aside, the other three rides are exceptional. Because it made me so nauseous, even with my patch, I’ll never go on the Incredible Hulk coaster again, but I was absolutely floored. I like to think that whenever Bruce reverts back to himself from Hulk, he feels so sick like I did getting off the ride.

Doctor Doom’s Fear Fall is excellent as well. I love Mission Breakout more, but this ride truly made me feel scared. Tied with Galactus, Doctor Doom is my favorite Marvel villain and probably my favorite comic book villain in general. I still love you though, Joker. The adrenaline rush before the first launch is indescribable, my heart was beating a million beats. And the queue with the Doombots is top-notch.

And finally, the Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man. I LOVE Rise of the Resistance, Mission Breakout, Indiana Jones and Space Mountain religiously,  but without hesitation, it is my absolute favorite theme park attraction ever. I played my animated Spider-Man DVDs on loop as a kid, and the first two Sam Raimi films are two of my favorite movies ever. So last  summer, when I finally went on it for the first time, this adult man in his early 20s was crying when he got off. The music, the effects, the cringy puns from the villains, everything. I’d gladly wait three hours for it again, ride it, then get back in line.

It’s sad how Transformers, a very similar ride from the same company that opened 13 years later, still pales in comparison to Spider-Man. What’s even worse is how Disney, the same company behind so many innovative attractions and Rise of the Resistance for Heaven’s sake, failed to create something on par with a ride that is over twenty years old. I read that because of the 1994 Marvel Universal contract, one of the conditions is that Disney can’t build a Marvel-themed simulator ride, but they could’ve done something more than a Toy Story Mania clone that’s basically pay to play. Fork over $65, and you can get a higher score with a Stark repulser blaster.

And the Doctor Strange show? Nothing more than a slightly cooler birthday party magic show with pretty colorful lights and a Thor cameo. 

With Bob Chapek (or “Cheapek” as the Disney fanbase calls him) now the CEO, I’m scared to see how he’ll more drastically cut costs and raise prices even more in the future. I don’t hate or dislike him, instead I hope he has an epiphany and changes his approach to things. Only time can tell. 

Anyways, thanks for reading. Sorry if it got a little long and pretentious.",Marvel,Super Hero Island is better than Avengers Campus

Film/Television,False,"(Spoiler Warning!) I know the original thanos was killed post snap. The Thanos from the reality they borrowed the infinity stones was snapped away. Yet there's probably countless other realities where Thanos does succeed. There's a chance in one of the millions of alternate universes he acquires pym particles and goes from universe to universe snapping. Then there's also the chance that there's a never ending cycle of the 2 universes where Thanos wins in one and then the other where the stones are borrowed from. Effectively reversing it in one and preventing it in the other. Then it opens the window for multiple sets of infinity stones being in a given universe. 

Then there's the possibility everyone can have a happy ending, they could get a Natasha from other universe just as they did with gamora. Thor could go to another universe and find a way to prevent deaths of Asgardians and find a way to stop ragnarok. Cap already lived out his life in another universe with agent carter, so this isn't out of scope. The only argument I could understand is that in every universe Natasha must sacrifice herself as well as tony (there was a q/a where they said he couldn't be snapped back cause it was only way) yet that assumes every universe follows the same linear events with same outcomes.",Marvel,Wouldn't Thanos still happen in alternate realities?

Raising the stakes  by threatening to destroy more than the Multiverse/Everything? Comical.  Raising the stakes by introducing an enemy stronger than the Living  Tribunal/The One Above All?

Comics ,False,"So the Beyonders were more powerfull than the Celestials, Eternity, Infinity Gauntlets and even the Living Tribunal. They eradicated the entire Marvel Pantheon and wiped out the entire Marvel Multiverse. Except The One Above All - absolutely nothing could stand in their way.

And yes I know that they were defeated - but this was through Plot Induced Stupidity because they were made to OP.

Regardles. After their defeat Molecule man has absorbed all of their powers. So now he should be the absolute top dog only second to TOAA. And then comes the Griever at the end of All things that effortlessly disposes of Molecule Man who has the collective Powers of the Beyonders....

This was just stupid. The Beyonders were a force from outside the Marvel Multiverse that completely dwarfed everything Marvel has ever seen before. But the Griever just disposes of someone who had absorbed their collective power. 

After the greatest threat ever that nearly wiped out the Multiverse - we got a force even stronger that wanted to wipe out the Multiverse.... This was just bad writing. Almost comical.",Marvel,The Griever at the End of all things ruins the gravity of the Incursions/The Beyonders

So the turn the Celestial into a marble like thing right? But.... his whole body is in the planet at this point. So wouldn't that mean the planet has a giant marble body mostly inside of it now?

Film/Television,False,"I, just like many of you I imagine, have finally gotten to watch Eternals. And I personally really enjoyed it. I just had one major gripe with the film over all, and that gripe came with a name. Albeit a name that is never actually spoken in the movie, but I’m talking about Kro.

This villain felt so forced into the film and so out of place in the finale that it just made him feel like a completely unnecessary plot point. Like, it felt like he was just thrown in so there was some action in the second act, as he served absolutely no purpose in the final fight. Here’s how I think it should have gone down instead.

Keep everything the same up until he’s in the cave with Thena. Pull a good subversion of expectations, and have him kill her right as you think she’s going to beat him. Suddenly, it cuts back to the beach, and a golden spear comes flying out of the cave into Phastos’ back. Kro absorbs his powers as well. Ikaris uses the moment of opportunity to fly to Sersi, rather than breaking free himself. Makkari runs at Kro to try and stop him, but he pins her down using Phastos’ tech, and absorbs her essence as well. Right as Ikaris is about to kill Sersi, but realised he can’t, have Kro super speed over and punch Ikaris, sending him flying into the ocean. The final fight would be Ikaris holding Kro at bay to stop him from killing Sersi (As for why he’s trying to kill her, I guess I didn’t think about that part. Just give him some plot reason to want the emergence to happen I guess) while she kills Tiamut.

I know it’s probably not a perfect fix. And I’m sure some of you actually preferred how Kro was handled in the movie compared to this. But I just feel like the stakes would’ve felt much higher during the climax, and there could’ve been somewhat of a redemption moment for Ikaris by having him protect the love of his life. I also would’ve liked to have incorporated Kingo into the final fight, but part of me actually likes that he just peaces out, showing that he doesn’t really care either which way about whether they stop the emergence or not. But anyways. What did you guys think of this alternate finale? Any thoughts or changes? Lemme know",Marvel,Minor fix for a character in the final battle of Eternals

Film/Television,False,"In the Venom movies Eddie is a loser. During an interview with the life foundation, he tries to expose them for using homeless people as test subjects. This ruins his life. This makes Eddie Brock an interesting character. He is a loser, because he is a good person. He had a job, a girlfriend and a high quality apartment. 

Making him a loser also creates a purpose for Venom. Venom is sentient, and he feels emotions. In the forest, Venom tells Eddie that he is weak and is pretty much a loser on his planet. Eddie makes Venom feel special, because Eddie uses Venom to save people . Let there be Carnage was worse than the first Venom in my opinion, but it shows more of Venoms character. Venom tries to comfort Eddie, but instead Eddie tells Venom that he can’t feel emotions because he isn’t human. This makes Venom question whether or not he needs Eddie. That makes him more interesting, he has conflict with his host.

Overall, i think Venom and Eddie are a perfect pair. Both Venom and Eddie are losers, but they are able to give each other purpose. Venom was a loser on his planet, but with Eddie he is a hero. Eddie is a loser, but he is a good person and tries to do the right thing. Venom gives Eddie a chance to do the right thing at a larger scale. Venom and Eddie are the perfect pair.

He has lived for centuries and never died from old age. But he is still defeated and killed in battle. 

He seems to think immortality is the same thing as invincibility. Invincibility = cant be hurt in battle but can be killed by natural causes. 

Immortality = you can’t die from old age or disease but can die from injures

I know a few black people who think black people who perfer other music genres than rap or hip hop are under represented. I think the upcoming Blade would be a great opportunity to break the mold.

My brothers birthday is coming up, he’s a marvel fan and enjoys the comics. 

I was quizzing him on it, he reads them all on some subscription app. He said something about having to wait 3 months for new comics to get put on there and otherwise you have to buy them individually. 

He mentioned it would be nice to have a few physical ones, it’s handier on digital but just for having sake it would be nice. 

So thought I’d get him something that is both new and physical. So I’m not getting him something he’s read before. 

Now I’m a fan of the film but hate reading so know jack shit about the comics.

Somehow Thanos killing off half of the universe counts as “human conflict” which makes no sense at all when he has destroyed planets and again he made half of the universe disappear. They couldn’t help at all in that?

Film/Television,False,"Just a thought, but after rewatching all of netflix's marvel shows, I wondered what everyone else other than America was experiencing.  

I would love to see local, directors, writers &amp; otherwise develop series of superheroes or non supes of their nation. No connection to marvel, no connection to any superhero (clearly as they barely interact with anyone outside the USA), but be able to refer to the ""Blip"". 

It immediately gives writers a good plot for character establishment i.e ""my family dissolved when I was a teenager &amp; now I'm a man"", or ""my parents dissapeared when I was a young boy/girl &amp; after developing in a new environment, this new development ensues"" &amp; so much more than I can be bothered to type. 

For a plot point that captivated so many audiences, it is rife with so many oppurtunities that, even though the show wouldn't acknowledge any marvel entity... it could bring forth so many shows with local, authentic &amp; passionate stories which deal with loss, development or even the opposite, where people fall down the proverbial hole...

The reason I say this, is that it unlocks a lot of potential for local production companies wherever they are to create these series. Of course some may be good, some may be god awful but the potential for up and coming writers to use this narrative to drive viewers, whilst nodding to the event... in my opinion, is limitless.

He could’ve also killed the first eternal lady, killed the deviants, and waited like before so they never hunt the Eternals down in London.

Film/Television,False,"I have been reading marvel comics for about 6 years now. I am 23 years old and grew up with the MCU films. Some of the best comic book stories have been introduced to people with gorgeous cinematography and attention to detail. I love the MCU but I have some critiques of it. Mainly it's failure to tell adult stories. I'm not saying everything should be R rated. That's definitely not the point of this post. However there are some genuinely moving stories in Marvel Comics that simply can't be told with a pg-13 rating. A good example of this is the Netflix Jessica Jones show which was largely about her overcoming her trauma as a SA survivor. The fact that they showed pretty clearly how awful that experience and the resulting PTSD can be was really cathartic for me as a SA survivor who has PTSD. The punisher show was also really great to me. My issue with the MCU is that limiting everything to being ""just for kids"" takes away the possibility of these very moving adult stories from being told. I like the MCU, but the fact that are willing to water down otherwise moving stories is very disappointing. A good example of this is completely changing Kate Bishop's origin story for the Hawkeye show. She was also an SA survivor. And if there is anything that the Deadpool movies and Logan have proved, it's that R rated comic book movies can still make tons of money. So the money argument doesn't really hold up. I don't want everything to be R rated. And I don't want every MCU show or movie to be dark and depressing. But stories that simply can't be told without an R rating shouldn't be watered down or scrapped for a younger audience. Marvel Comics is full of a diverse catalog of wonderful stories to tell. It's the fact that these comics can be so different from each other, and have their own narrative feel and audience that made me love the comics. The MCU could be elevated to an entirely new level if they diversify their connected universe to include adult audiences.",Marvel,Why I love and hate the MCU part 1
Film/Television,False,"I went to go see this in the theaters like any loyal MCU stan and walked out when the deviants first attacked in London. My kiddo wasn’t having it so we left. I wasn’t that upset because that part is at least 20 minutes in and although, the movie starts with a battle it literally was like a cold opening somehow. I can’t blame the cast. What a tremendous group of people they got for this. I get that the Director recently became an Academy Award winner yada yada but this was the slowest, most boring Marvel movie I have ever seen. Gemma Chan is fucking delightful actor and somehow was unable to carry this film because of the poor screenplay and directing. I’m literally beside myself with whatever it is I just watched. The classic MCU humor fell flat, the action sequences were lame, the stylization of the Deviants was lacking, I have no idea what the laughably bad rendering of the leprechaun thing was at the end and the post credit scene was completely lost on me. Lawd now I understand why nobody has made any Eternals memes.

He then brings his wife back to life and he can see that Mercedes believes Deadpool is her ex-husband and even after the truth comes out and she finds out she is actually T-Rays wife, she hates T-Ray anyway for bringing her back from the dead (I do get why she's angry though).

Film/Television,False,"Marvel will reboot X-men 97 animated series, bringing forth the main villain, the dweller in darkness, someone that has been shown a bit on the “what if” and was the main antagonist of Shang Chi. On the original XM97 animated series, the ending is abrupt and continued on the comics, where the dweller of darkness ends up devouring the whole world, creating an ending to the XM97 and Pre versions. This reboots the marvel universe in the main 616 universe, the comic ends with a final panel showing the original X-men in the 616 universe.

This could mean two things, one, the 616 universe suddenly adopts the X-men and creates a paradox type effect where two universe overlaps yet don’t disrupt each other, but this would cause gaps on the story, but would connect both universes(Fox and Marvel CU) or two, it just explains how the 616 was created.

This point goes even further. The MCU suddenly had a break on the space-time continuum, thanks to both Spider-Man No Way Home and Doctor Strange Multiverse Of Madness, this brought and will(possibly, as explained later, connect the MCU, SCU and FCM) on the later mentioned film, Wanda Maximoff is a key point of it, helping Dr.Strange fix the multiverse, and now, “what if”, Wanda, gets teased by The dweller in darkness, or possibly Mephisto, to connect the realities, overlapping her ORIGINAL X-men timeline with her MCU timeline, in an attempt for her to get her sons, lover and brother back.

If this were to be true, and if these two merge, there could be a possibility for the deceased MCU characters to be rebooted or brought back to the 616 CU continuum(Bringing Cap and Iron-Man back, alongside with the X-men and MAYBE the fantastic 4)-side tracking a bit; on the ending scene of Spider-Man No Way Home, Holland Can be seen wearing a spider suit very reminiscent of that used on the original run of the comic “The Amazing Spider-Man” where he meets and briefly “joins” the fantastic 4, this can mean the fantastic 4 could make an appearance, which would make sense with a later point I will be discussing on this essay.

With the MCU, FCU and SCU all under the same universe, thanks to Wanda Maximoff and Dr.Strange, Shang Chi’s villain can come forth and shine as bright as it once did in the comics, causing a disturbance so strong that the X-men and Avengers have to team up to defeat it, as on the previous universe the X-men weren’t enough, and even though we saw Shang Chi “defeating” TDID, a threat not even the full X-men team could defeat, I am but certain it wasn’t but an illusion or one of his minions, making an act so TDID could escape without them noticing(much like the venom symbiote on the post-credit scenes of the last marvel movies, which I would talk about separately)

This would take years to accomplish and would probably be teased this Phase and Brought into fruition on the next one. Defeating TDID would bring forth another character into view, and that’s Galactus, the final villain of the MCU. This would take at least 10 years to start, on the final phase of the MCU the fantastic 4 will be needed thanks to their connection with Silver Surfer, here we might see something in between these two phases, and this I speculate to be Knull, as the Symbiote from SCU talked about the hive mind and their history rich knowledge, this implies the existence of knull, someone capable of eliminating the celestials, in this space in between phases, we might see a Spider-Man and F4 Team up like in the comics, the introduction of captain universe and other heroes, in this Im-between episode, the FF, the avengers and the X-men get to know each other and create bonds, this would end on the destruction of knull and a more prominent role for Spider-Man and its spider verse-which I will diverge from for a bit and talk about morbius.

In morbius(a part of the SCU) we can see a poster calling Spider-Man a killer, this ties back to the scene where AG is introduced and he talks about how he “stopped pulling out his punches” and we can speculate, using lethal force.

Think im gonna approach the dawn of X series the same way unless you guys have better reasoning!",Marvel,"Just finished reading House of X/Powers of X, anyone confused with the reading order?"
Comics ,False,I haven’t seen him attached to any upcoming comic book solicitations. Does anyone know what he’s up to?,Marvel,What’s up with Ed McGuinness?
Film/Television,False,"So after watching the defenders when it first came out I was not as excited for future of the Netflix marvel universe and stopped watching. After seeing Charlie cox pop back up in no way home I decided to finish daredevil season 3 and can I say I was very impressed. Daredevil to me was by far the best series but this season was amazing. Dex was menacing and anytime he and Matt fought I felt that he had the upper hand and could beat him each and everytime. Kingpin was again played amazingly by Vincent literally felt untouchable. I hope Disney uses the character as well as the show runners for the previous shows did. We only got a taste of him in the Hawkeye series but for Clint to be so concerned of his involvement means they have big plans for him, I would guess.",Marvel,Daredevil season 3
Film/Television,False,"Wolverine never got his iconic mask in the Fox films, but so has Hawkeye in the MCU. The funny thing is both are similar, and both were never used because they thought it was too silly. I for sure thought Hawkeye would use it in his show but the show shied away from it.

Do you think Wolverine will get his mask within the MCU? If he gets it, it will feel even weirder Hawkeye never got his. But part of me feels they'll never give Logan the mask like they didn't give Hawkeye his",Marvel,"Since Hawkeye never got his iconic mask within the MCU, do you think Wolverine also won't get his?"
Comics ,False,"So Jamie Madrox aka Multiman infamously absorbed his son with Siryn due to him not knowing that his dupe had slept with Siryn, and thus his son would be absorbed like a dupe upon being touched. However, we've also seen that the same dupe can be manifested by Madrox after being absorbed, (ex, the x-factor dupe). So would it be plausible or interesting for Madrox's son to be manifested, maybe he could be aged up a number of years that'd be plausible since his birth, and Madrox has the memories of his dupes so maybe he could start off as a character rather than a baby",Marvel,(SPOILERS FOR X-Factor Investigations) Would it be plausible or interesting for Multiman's son to be brought back into the comics?
Film/Television,False,"Just watched Eternals (average at best) 

There’s one bit in it where the gay fellas son calls Robb Stark superman. Does this mean that Superman exists in the MCU? Because if it does then surely that means that Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne exist in the same universe 🤯",Marvel,MCDCU
Other,False,"When the fact that growing the population and with all the endless wars we Humans love to do is all part of growing the population so that a New celestials being can be born it shows that thanos was the good guy.

By keeping the population down and therefor preventing the birth of an celestial he saved the human race and earth in one way.

He Allso sees the bigger picture of cleaning earth of its bad People to make room for good.",Marvel,Thanos is and allways where a good guy in the bigger picture of the celestials way of growing.
Comics ,False,"Wondering if anyone can help me, I'm trying to find out if there was an issue of Daredevil released in January 2001 and if so, what number and title would I be looking for? Hoping it has a David Mack cover as it's for an upcoming 21st birthday gift.
Thanks in advance for any help anyone can offer!",Marvel,Daredevil comics
Games,False,"I think it's a bit confusing to just add ""Marvel's"" before the name of the lead

It just defaults to people calling something like Marvel's Avengers just ""Avengers game"" which makes looking for certain stuff about the games online kinda hard (ex; the Avengers game subreddit is called PlayAvengers, and is a little tough to find)

Plus it seems like sequels won't be having subtitles either? The new Spidey game is just Spider-Man 2 and Miles' game also has a very loose title with ""Marvel's Spider-Man Miles Morales""

idk it just bugs me a little",Marvel,Thoughts on the current Marvel video game naming convention?
Artwork,False,"I've been looking online for a poster for the entire X-Men film franchise but can't find one. I'm talking something that includes all xmen films, all Wolverine/Logan films, and all Deadpool films. Does anyone have anything like that or able to make it?",Marvel,X-Men Franchise poster?
Comics ,False,Clone Conspiracy ironically was pretty straightforward to follow and I have little gripes with it.,Marvel,"Change My View: The Kindred arc in Nick Spencer's ASM run is a convoluted mess, brutalized by executive meddling, with snarled-up storytelling second to only the Clone Saga."
Other,False,"So as Daredevil/Kingpin made a cameo in MCU, are Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage canon to mcu?",Marvel,Marvel-Netflix Shows
Film/Television,False,I haven’t watched the Avengers movies in a while now and was wondering what the current Avengers roster is.,Marvel,What’s the current Avengers roster in the MCU?
Comics ,False,"I was looking at someone on tiktok going over a specific book or comic relating to Sorcerers and time travel, and it talked about off limit universes/timelines, such as 2099 timeline, House of M timeline, and the Amalgam universe. It was some sort of guide or book but I’m not sure what the name of it was. Any ideas? I can’t find the tiktok video of it anymore. Thanks!",Marvel,Help finding Doctor Strange book/comic?
Comics ,False,"Should be a fan of tv shows,mcu &amp; comic's",Marvel,Hello marvel fans dm me I'm bored af let's talk
Other,False,"Why wouldn't this happen? With the concept of traveling through the multiverse at play, Disney can do anything within their legal parameters to their worlds. It would be a huge opportunity for a new line of toys, clothes and of course movies. Marvel is at an all-time high and Star Wars could need its help to bounce back in popularity.",Marvel,Marvel/Star Wars-crossover before 2030.
Comics ,False,"By casual, I mean something that doesn't involve Universe-ending threats or time traveling. Just some fun superhero action and maybe some humor?",Marvel,"Are there any good ""casual"" Avengers comics?"
Other,False,"It doesn't seem like the people who got snapped were really dead. They were just...not on earth anymore. If they were truly dead, I doubt there would be a way to bring them back at all. So since Wanda is a super powerful Nexus Being/Scarlet Witch/mutant, could she have gotten herself out? 

If she can create a whole ""real"" reality, with random people walking and talking (WandaVision), does that mean she's pretty much capable of anything having to do with altering reality? Her powers seem really really epic. In Demons of Dark Design (comics) she in fact *did* get herself out of a fake reality made by Master Pandemonium.",Marvel,"Could Wanda Maximoff have magicked herself out of the Thanos snap limbo given that one of her powers is being able to alter reality, among others?"
Comics ,False,Looking to read more Silver Surfer after reading Silver Surfer Black. Was wondering what the thoughts and opinions were on Slotts run? And is it any good? Thanks y’all!,Marvel,Thoughts on Dan Slott’s Silver Surfer run?
Comics ,False,"Taskmaster is supposed a guy who can copy people moves by looking at them but people keep saying he’s a jobber.
I wonder if he ever beat any powerful characters ever?",Marvel,Has Taskmaster ever beaten anyone big before?
Film/Television,False,"In season 1, episode 10 of daredevil. Foggy and Matt are engaging in a legal against Roxxon Energy Corporation. And just moments when we see Matt (Daredevil) reading. Foggy said he bumped into “Morales”. This Spider-Man Miles Morales before Spider-Man Miles Morales.",Marvel,Daredevil Spider-Man connection
Comics ,False,"I'm not sure if it exists somewhere or if I'm misremembering, but in preparation for X-Men 97, I've been watching the animated series and I thought I remembered a comic series based on the events after it? I checked the wiki and they don't have any references to comics set in ""The 92niverse"".

I'm not all up to speed with the comics and stuff as I only picked up a comic a few days ago. Other than the X-Men and MCU movies (and the 90s and 2000s movies) 

I don't really know that much about Marvel characters outside of that and wanted to know more. Does that comic series exist? It was like a sequel to it and it supposedly wrapped up that universes story ripe for a reboot. Like a universe ending event in the last episode.",Marvel,Old comic continuation of X-Men TAS?
Film/Television,False,I think Thor would have sided with cap because I dont think the accords mean anything to him. Not sure about the hulk though,Marvel,What would have happened if Thor and the Hulk were present during the airport fight in Civil War?
Games,False,Bonus: movie Guardians of the Galaxy vs game guardians of the Galaxy.,Marvel,"If in any medium, there's a crossover between the MCU Avengers and the Square Enix Avengers, what would happen?"

Film/Television,False,MCU looks almost all set with his Uncle already having the gear and Ned going to college. So are they teasing a Miles Morales Spiderman movie (MCU) or just giving out cruel easter eggs?,Marvel,Miles Morales live action movie when?

Comics ,False,They were probably one of my favorite couples but I was kinda disappointed that the romance story got abandoned after he went to space.,Marvel,Did Flash Thompson and Valkyrie ever reconnect after he came back?

Cosplay ,False,"I scared myself lol, we look pretty similar IMHO.

Comics ,False,"So I’m reading Moon Knight 2006 and Moon Knight just cut off Taskmaster’s mask and revealed his face. 

But in the “Hunted” series in the new TASM, Spider-Man says to Taskmaster “Didn’t that mask get fused to your skin?” and Black-Ant says that he’s sensitive about it. 

I thought it was a mask

Does anybody know the story about how the mask got fused to his face?",Marvel,Taskmaster Question
Film/Television,False,"I hadn't even heard about it until today and saw it add on Disney. The reviews are absurd. Was it rejected just because of the lesbian relationship? It was fine. It wasn't forced. It was a perfectly good interpretation. I liked everything about it. The casting was good. The pacing may have been unusual compared to, say, Spiderman. But this is a different approach. I'm actually disappointed this was panned by critics and fans.",Marvel,New Mutants movie was good
Film/Television,False,"And then in infinity war he couldn’t suck up his pride to call Steve and then had the audacity to get mad at Steve for “not being there” even though he was there.

Just rewatching marvel and kind of realizing how Tony is king of a skeeze ball who is overpraised. And there’s a lot of double standards when it comes to him and other characters who do the same things he has done.",Marvel,Tony Stark blackmailed a high schooler to fight in a battle and use him as a buffer so he could force his friend to turn in a victim and sign his rights away (to “keep them in check” even though ultron was Tony’s fault). He also tried to straight up murder Bucky who was innocent.
Comics ,False,"Where did he get so good at fighting 

What are his powers exactly 

What is his backstory before becoming deadpool in the comics or the movie

Why does he joke so much

Who are his villains and what heroes has he collaborated with?",Marvel,Can anyone give me some backstory/info on Deadpool?
Other,False,The most exiting thing about Vincent D'Onofrio's Kingpin being in the MCU is that we could get to see him make another omelet,Marvel,Egg
Film/Television,False,"Unlike X-Men, EMH was abruptly cancelled and many storylines weren't finished. X-Men had multiple seasons and basically went over multiple major arcs. Multiple people were asking for more EMH but why didn't Marvel brought it back? Hell it's the Avengers, it's their biggest moneymaker too. And it's more recent in people's memories too and had good writing",Marvel,Why did Marvel brought back the 90s X-Men Animated Series but not Earth's Mightiest Heroes?
Film/Television,False,"Anyone else think that going to dr strange was unnecessary?  Peter could have just asked pepper potts and stark industries to give him a reference to MIT or just pay for him to get in, tony literally donated millions to MIT and went there so the school would owe him favors.",Marvel,Why didn’t Peter just ask Pepper Potts to help him get in MIT
Film/Television,False,"Hi everyone, I’m a big marvel fan, but I’m in a place that has recently gone into lockdown due to Omicron. There are no streaming services I know of offering No Way Home, and my preorder on iTunes will only become available in March. I could wait patiently until then if everyone had to wait, but the trouble is that everyone in regions that are not locked down can see the movie, and spoilers are everywhere. 

As much as I try to stay out of marvel spaces, the only way to avoid spoilers is by getting off the internet entirely, which is just not doable. Is there anything I’m missing- a streaming service or faster delivery preorder I can use to watch this movie? I would even go to an outdoor movie theatre in Toronto. I’m in Canada, but I can use a VPN. I’m willing to spend $20-30 to watch this if I need to subscribe to something new.

Also accepting tips to avoid spoilers.

TL;DR: need legal options to watch no way home from Canada while in lockdown, as there are too many spoilers to avoid.",Marvel,How to (legally) watch No Way Home while theatres are closed in Ontario
Film/Television,False,"I don’t know if this has ever been answered before, but why didn’t someone just destroy the books in the restricted section of the library? Specifically the one dude’s name that I can’t spell (starts with K), why didn’t they just destroy that book and avoid everything that happened?",Marvel,Dr Strange question
Film/Television,False," We learn from the first Spiderman movie that there are 32,000 species of spiders and they are of order Araneae and have 3 subgroups Arachnids which all have varying strengths.

Then, we learn of different spiders and their powers (not all though).

First, we learn about the Delana spider which jumps to catch it's prey.

Second, we learn about the Funnel Web spider which spins intricate funnel shaped webs whose strands have a tensile strength proportionally equal to the type of high-tension wire.

Third, we learn about the Grass spider and the guide says that Grass spider hunts using a set of reflexes with nerve conduction velocity so fast that some researchers believe it almost borders on precognition and earns awareness of danger, a *spider sense*.

Also, we see another spider which Tobey explains to Harry that it can change colors to blend with it's environment and it uses it as a defense mechanism.

Then, the guide/scientist explains that the combined genetic information from the 3 spiders (which we see from the tv that they are the Delana, Funnel Web and Agelenidae which I presume is the Grass spider) are put into the 15 super spiders. Then Tobey gets bit by one of the 15 super spiders and gets the powers of Delana (to jump quickly and catch), Funnel Web (slinging a high-tensile web from his wrist) and Grass spider (spider sense). (also in the tv it is mentioned web tensile strength and spider strength for Funnel Web, jumping and speed for Delana, spider sense, pre-cognition and speed for Grass spiders respectively)

Now, since Tobey has the knowledge that his spider powers have been received from that super spider bite, he could have gone back to Columbia to add some other spiders genome to a super spider and make it bite him to get those spiders powers too. Why didn't he do that? I have no idea. It's a missed opportunity. If he just added the camouflage spider's genome to the super spider and got bit again, he would have got the camouflage ability which is super cool and stealthy.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, in the multiverses of Amazing Spiderman and Tom Holland's Spiderman, they don't have the natural web slinging capabilities like Tobey does. I am guessing it's due to the fact that the super spider in their world which bit them didn't have the genome of the Funnel Web spider added to it.",Marvel,Tobey Maguire could have had more!
Film/Television,False,"Hello! I have a bit of time on my hands at the moment so thought I might finally tackle the MCU movies. I've seen some over the years like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ragnarok. I went on a little googling adventure to see where to start and I'm just confused? I have some questions...

A) Should I watch them in Phase (chronological) order or in instalment order (ie all the Spidey movies, all the Avenger movies etc)?

B) Erm why does the MCU start in 2008? What happened to the old Tobey Spidey movies and all the others?\*

C) Why aren't Deadpool/Wolverine/Venom etc in the MCU?\*

Ok thanks a lot!

\*Ok, I found another list starting in 1986 with Howard the Duck and it covers ALL the Marvel movies - old Spidey, new Spidey, Deadpool, everyone is included. I am not committed enough to do this list! But again, why is there a different list starting in 2008 with Iron Man? Cheers!",Marvel,MARVEL'S REALLY CONFUSING CINEMATIC UNIVERSE
Comics ,False,What is your favorite short Marvel comic series? I’m not looking for a super long one. I’m stumped on what to read next.,Marvel,Look for suggestions
Games,False,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDlE5nSrFUQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vDlE5nSrFUQ),Marvel,Marvel VS Capcom 3's Intro Represents A Time Marvel Was Willing to Make Bold Creative Decisions and Recognize It's Comic Roots Instead of Defaulting To Safe MCU Stuff. Change my mind.
Other,False,"Just a fun mental image I had, would that actually work or does Spiderman lack the strength to do so",Marvel,Could Spiderman theoretically grab Mjolnir with his webbing and use it as a flail?
Comics ,False,"""Ghost Rider is the name of a generation of men and women possessed by the spirit of vengeance, granting them incredible powers (and awesome designs). Their latest one to join? Johnny Blaze. A man that gave everything up to the devil to save the person that matter to him the most in this world, only to have that blow up in his face, condemning him to spend the rest of his days as an enforcer of retribution, stuck between the fight of heaven and hell"".

That's Ghost Rider. Pretty cool, right? SO WHY THE HELL DOESN'T HE HAVE GREAT STORIES?! The only ones that were good were Jason Aaron's run and Roobie Reyes origin stories. I'm probably missing some other good run, but my point is: For a character with some much narrative potential as him, GR has had very few solo books, and most of them were either good or just straight up bad. Nothing GREAT or FANTASTIC. 

In light of GR's 50 anniversary and Marvel annoucing this as ""the year of vengeance"" and a new Ghost Rider solo book coming out this february, what are your thoughs about this?",Marvel,Is Ghost Rider the hero with the biggest waste of narrative potential?
Other,False,"No this post isn't asking to literally make a game together.

So lets say Insomniac, the company who made the Spider-Man PS4/5 games are are currently developing a wolverine game, are making a Captain America game. What would you like to see in in? Game mechanics, storyline, characters, easter eggs, different suits, locations, all the stuff that made the spider-man game amazing.

So for me im not sure if I would like to see the game take place in WW2 and go over his origin, or would it be a spidey situation where we star the story where he's been a hero for a while. Maybe The first game can take place during WW2 and if there is a sequel in can take place in modern day. 

So the storyline I for me would be that this could be Caps last WW2 missions before he gets frozen and the main villain of the game would be baron zemo as he is the last villain cap fought before getting frozen. 

The most important game mechanic would of course his shield throw with the factor of how would it be implemented in fights and the other fun ways he will be able to use it even with out throwing it. Other mechanic would be Caps parkour skills as he is very agile too and his fighting style as he is one of the best hand to hand fighter in the Marvel universe

Characters I would like to see would ofc be Bucky and peggy carter, bucky being how he looked like in the comics and maybe there would be some parts of the game where we could play as bucky. With peggy I'm indecisive as ever since 2011 every version of peggy has basically been a Hayley atwell or a variant of it, even in the avengers cartoon and [the game](https://i.redd.it/3tm6lx0lnrd71.jpg). I like her but maybe a more comic base peggy would be a nice change. Instead of a brunette British fighting for the Americans we can have a blonde American fighting for the french like in the comics 

Different suits, ofc every MCU suit would make an appearance here and the shield would be customizable too. Other suits I would like to see would be his [OG suit](https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/3/a0/5991fa03329b7/clean.jpg) from his first comic, [The Captain suit](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a5/a6/ef/a5a6efa32b65b6e255d781f5607bd552.jpg) and a [WW2 style suit](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FMT/IW30/H7ANSESM/FMTIW30H7ANSESM.jpg), or like [this](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelcinematicuniverse/images/0/06/First_Uniform.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/231?cb=20210318141605). And [there are too many options for the shield to name](https://i.redd.it/r0qbcyncveg51.png), maybe different shields have different abilities 

Ester eggs would be so many, but ofc it would be focus on caps earliest days and the Marvel universe fist few years. There references about Namor, the original human torch, the all winners squad and the the invaders and other comic Golden age marvel stuff.

That are some of my few ideas of what I would like to see in a Captain America game, tell me what you think and let me hear what would you guys like to see in a game focus on Steve Rogers",Marvel,(Discussion) Lets make an Insomniac Captain America game together

Even though Spider-Man, Hulk and the X-Men were more famous it never seemed right for these characters to be the face of Marvel, or at least the big players of Marvel. That's like if the Flash, Captain Atom and the Doom Patrol ended up as DC's best selling heroes and overshadowed Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman and became DC's most famous heroes. It was an organic success for them but never felt by design.

Even weirder before the MCU when Marvel's most well known and ""A list"" heroes were Spider-Man, X-Men, Fantastic Four and... Blade, Ghost Rider, Daredevil and Elektra. What an odd lineup.

Steve Rogers is traditionally a very well written, inspiring character with a cool political undergirding to a lot of his stories. I think Civil War is absolutely inspiring on Steve’s part. Some fantastic writing. Same with the X-Men in the early days. FATWS’s version of Sam Wilson however (not previous MCU features of Sam), is an example of a primarily political character with some small moments of good writing and dialogue breaking through the heavy handed messaging, delivered by the very talented Anthony Mackie where he’s clearly trying his best with what he’s given. Nowadays, (and this is true with the comics too) the political messaging takes precedent over the narrative.  Gradually, these stories have devolved from films and books featuring great characters and skilled writing used to demonstrate admirable political messages (or other ideals) to now becoming films and books used to display grand political ideas conveyed through the medium of hollow and neglected characters.",Marvel,"I had commented this elsewhere and wanted to gauge what you guys think of this subject.

While mutants, mutates, and inhumane on the other hand have powers that tend to be more broad, vague, and not defined. IIRC, all Inhumans have enhanced strength or physicals. I'm sure that's a good start to making them stand out from other super-powered human offshoots groups in the Marvel Universe. But other than that differences between all 3 are not that visible.

So, one of the things I appreciated with the movies are that eventually, the heroes have to pass on the mantle. With that, the writers make more effort to provide character growth worthy of a hero (or a villain). With that in mind, I feel that the MCU Tony has evolved better (albeit under different circumstances, not having Arno as a brother paid off although the 3rd movie is one of my least fav marvel films) than PMS


Don't get me wrong, PMS has evolved a lot. In fact, I'm enjoying the last Ironman book (it's definitely refreshing to see Tony not die again when on the verge of death🤣🤣🤣, seriously though, that guy can take it ).

Film/Television,False,"Both as a character and as a cog in the Marvel machine I think this iteration of Peter Parker is deeply wanting.

**1.** He's an attempted murderor                                                                                                                                **2.** The Last two conflicts of the last two movies have both been his fault.                                                                                                                                **3.** Aunt May's death is directly linked to his inability to think of calling MIT. Like Really?

He doesn't deserve to be a hero. And he constantly gives us reasons to not support him. NWH is the most egregious offender of this as the movie itself is based on the most filmsy motivations ever.4. The Multiverse is messed up because of bad PR and a botched Spell. A spell that didn't need to be botched If there was better communication. Really? 

**5.** Pete has Stark Resources and the entire super hero community on his side and couldn't think of a non-magic solution?                                                                                                                                                          **6.** Pete risks the universe to possibly save some people who have already died?Not to mention that MJ must have been watching the commotion online and still decided not to press the magical artifact. In general all the avoidable collateral damage that Peter has inflicted on the world makes me believe in Jameson. From the evidence we have so far he is a public menace. And he obviously needs more biology lessons if he thinks someone can survive being hit by glider at speed. Ambulance maybe? Induced coma? They must have been options.

Another major issue is that at this point of the MCU it just doesn't make sense for other heroes to be absent when there's a major crisis.  He was literally called the 'most famous person' in the world. How did the current Sorceror Supreme not feel or see that something was wrong?

**7.** Nick Fury must have other assets or back up plans for such a disaster. Being off world isn't an excuse especially since he was in the Mysterio situation and culpable in legitimising him. This kind of situation is literally all he's good for.                                                                                                                             **8.** At the very least give some concrete reasons why everyone is not there and why Peter would not try to ask everyone else for help.                                                                                                                                   **9.** Running to magic at the first sign of trouble instead of just Black Panther, or someone else, speaking on your behalf doesn't make sense.

Other than all that seeing Tom, Tobey and  Garfield together was awesome. But yeah, If not for nostalgia I would not have enjoyed this at all.  We deserve better storytelling from Marvel.

**10.** The writers found the most contrived way to force this Spidey to be aligned to other previous iterations. He didn't need to have Aunt May die for him to be a genuine Spiderman. And if she was going to die it shouldn't have been because he was to dumb to restrain Osborn, knowing he's mentally unstable. In fact him being part of the avengers, being part of the MCU, having a mentor and having all the gadgets was what made him unique. He was a next gen superhero and that's what was cool about him.

So yeah, NWH and Tom Holland's Spidey were and are a huge disappointment for me. The line when Aunt May said ""with great power comes great responsibility"" was one of the most flat and cringe moments in superhero cinematic history. Only second to the ""Martha"" momemt in BVS, and then Star Lord and the gauntlet come in for a solid third.

Again, I just feel like we deserve better.",Marvel,Tom Holland's Spiderman is the Worst Spidey We've Ever Seen (NWH Review)

Film/Television,False,"Prefacing this post i havent looked at any plot leak or any of the sort as to keep this theory post natural and organic.

&amp;#x200B;

Now heres my little theory that i had come up with, I will be using the What if episode 4 about how Dr Strange as the basis of this theory, ik it sounds stupid basing the plot of the new movie to a ""what if"" episode channeling that it is a series on ""what if"" events but my guess is that despite this flaw in my argument, it is still the closest to the consistency of how the MCU runs its story, so I will go by this.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, as a TLDR intro, episode 4 is about a different universe where instead of losing his hands in his ""absolute"" incident, he was instead in a healthy relationship with Christine Palmer and instead suffer the consequences of her dying in exchange of becoming dr strange. Long story short, he goes into a journey to prevent her death using the eye of agamotto and eventually split into ""two timelines"" in the same universe - one where dr strange seek the knowledge to prevent christine's death and another moving on her death and saving the universe - the latter loses and universe collapses.

&amp;#x200B;

Moving on to how im using this as the basis of my theory, this is because, as an MCU material, it delves into the consistency of how they want the cinematic universe to not go crazy as with the comics (yet that is, also sorry for this little ignorancy of comics as i am an MCU fan), and after watching both the trailer and the episode found some similarities between the plot of both.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 1: Significance and Purpose of the multiverse in this movie

Moving on to my theory now (I apologise for this long ass intro ahaha). We see that the trailer for the new Dr Strange movie 2 begins with Wong explaining the dangers of the multiverse and a shot of his broken watch. Now this is important as with the What if episode, Strange uses the eye of Agamotto to do his deed, where in this universe, Strange will tamper with the multiverse somehow to do his deed (HA HA ik multiverse whoa its in the title im a smart one arent I, kill me pls. trust me it i believe it gets better). I also believe, that his broken watch is a strong foreshadow in this following wongs statement as a way that maybe delivers Strange's wanting to use the multiverse to tamper with his past since he still has not forgotten about it.

&amp;#x200B;

Point 2: Collapsing universe

At 0:23 of the trailer, Strange cuts into a reality that is clearly warping out of existence, this was the first indication that I may be onto something here, as with the what if episode, similar scene occur when strange began to motion his plans to prevent Christine's death. The universe is collapsing on itself as he has tampered with an absolute point in time.

[https://youtu.be/Rt\_UqUm38BI?t=23](https://youtu.be/Rt_UqUm38BI?t=23)

&amp;#x200B;

Point 3: Motive??

From 0:39-0:41 Strange see who I believe Christine getting married, IDK im throwing something without basis here, but im filling this in as his motive per se?? but im shooting the stars with this one ahaha perhaps not in itself a flashback but in the beginning of the movie? time will tell.

[https://youtu.be/Rt\_UqUm38BI?t=39](https://youtu.be/Rt_UqUm38BI?t=39)

&amp;#x200B;

Point 4: Strange wanting to learn more (and perhaps tamper) with the multiverse

You know at 0:50, we move into a scene in a garden of Wanda's tree farm, and Strange asks about multiverse, What if (HA HA), this isnt a part where Strange asks a way to defeat his ""other self - multiverse self?"" and somewhere at the beginning of the movie asking for a way to tamper with his past etc etc. I mean it does make sense right as hes not in a panic or a rush to use this knowledge to defeat someone, and idk after having this theory in mind Strange demeanor in this scene seems a little ""strange"" as if hes looked for her in secret. Plus to note, we never got to see his hands once between their interaction maybe a point here ahaha, possibly because hes wearing his watch? ahaha.

[https://youtu.be/Rt\_UqUm38BI?t=50](https://youtu.be/Rt_UqUm38BI?t=50)

&amp;#x200B;

Point 5: Wanda things 

1:31-1:33, here we see Wanda doing some thing, perhaps her demonstrating how to manipulate the universe? tbh i got nothing here to prove this other than, trying to make sense the chronological timeline of these scenes.

[https://youtu.be/Rt\_UqUm38BI?t=91](https://youtu.be/Rt_UqUm38BI?t=91)

&amp;#x200B;

Point 6: The hand

Now heres the chunky boi, Mordo states that the biggest threat to their universe is Strange himself, at first i thought - hmm multiverse, could it be because a strange from a different multiverse is trying to destroy other universe??"" - but after watching what if episode 4, and seeing that episode's consistency to the MCU canon, maybe its because (similar to the episode) he attempts to tamper with an absolute event in his past which can destroy the universe, pretty consistent to Mordo's quote id say (hope so). Finally, at 1:43, we see an undamaged hand from Strange himself, almost as if it did not suffer the fate of the accident. seeing this scene was what gave me this crazy revelation of a theory to come together, especially with what comes after with what we see two Dr Stranges having a talk. Here's where i believe the conclusion will set out, with the two Stranges setting things straight going the same motions as the conclusion of the what if episode only for the ""good"" Strange to come out on top. 

[https://youtu.be/Rt\_UqUm38BI?t=103](https://youtu.be/Rt_UqUm38BI?t=103)

&amp;#x200B;

Extra Stuff:

\- The trailer shows lots of red stuff, preluding to the introduction of his absorbtion of the mystic beings or something of the kind and becoming a darker sorcerer.

\- I found that hand joke at the end of the trailer really funny and with my theory in mind, its deeper and found it even more funny ahaha

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I believe the movie will be about Dr Strange attempting to tamper with his past - mainly, something to do with preventing his accident - leading to a destruction of the universe. and one way or another, two Stranges come about (probably with the ancient one splitting him between two timelines in one universe as well as strange is the one that can only defeat strange, or a similar kind) and they confront eachother, who wins. Obviously, the ""good"" strange wins because that would be GG MCU but yea ahaa.

&amp;#x200B;

Other,False,"One... Interesting comic run was Howard The Duck Vol. 5 - 6. They brought back a character that's been with Marvel since '73. The run itself was... Ok, it wasn't the worst thing out there, I have read much worse comics, it was pretty disappointing because Gerber's run in the 70's was one of my all time favorite comic runs. But what caused that sudden dip in popularity?  Why did Marvel bring back Howard? And did they kill him again?

Howard the Duck was introduced in 1973 by Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik, and appeared in Adventure  into Fear, until being a backup feature in Giant-Size Man-Thing. By 1976 Marvel had given Howard his own Series, without the horror parodies from Giant-Size Man-Thing. And the thing about Howard is that despite looking like Daffy or Donald Duck, he isn't a cartoon, he's flesh and blood. From a quote from Gerber he stated:  ""If Wile E. Coyote gets run over by a steamroller, the result is a pancake-flat coyote who can be expected to snap back to three dimensions within moments; if Howard gets run over by a steamroller, the result is blood on asphalt."". The joke with Howard with Howard is that there was no joke, Howard was treated as if he was human and not a cartoon duck. In 1977 Disney threatened to sue marvel because he looked like Donald Duck so Marvel gave Howard pants. In 1980 Marvel tried to make a Howard the duck movie with Steve Gerber suing, but Marvel won the case, like that meant anything because the movie sucked. Howard later made cameos in: Sensational She-Hulk, Spider-Man Team-Up and others. Until Marvel made a Marvel Max Mini-Series, and it was... ok. Then for some reason, out of all characters they picked to make a comic run for, for All New, All Different Marvel, they picked Howard the Duck, then his series was ok, then he made lot's of cameos, despite it being canonically impossible because he was stuck in a sort of meta dimension, and a cameo in the MCU with a Hulu show being worked on until eventually being axed off. 

Howard the Duck in essence is about existentialism and satire. Which sucks because the movie ditched all of that in favor for... something, certainly something. But to answer the questions asked earlier, why did Howard have a sudden dip in popularity? It's probably because of the movie tarnishing the name of the character and people just seeing it as dirty jokes and risque humor. Why did they bring back Howard? I have no idea. Why did they kill him off again? Probably because of lukewarm reception and poor sales because of the movie.",Marvel,What ever happened to Howard The Duck?

Film/Television,False,"I've been playing through the game and I adore it, but I also love the movies. Here's my take on which iteration of the character is better.

**Star Lord- Movie**

The game version is fine, but he feels like he's past his prime and fixing stuff about his life, and things like the music feel more tacked on rather than a part of his character. Also, Chris Pratt's Star Lord was perfectly content with having his last words be ""I'm distracting you, you big turd blossom."" I also feel like the classic rock played way more into Chris Pratt's character. 

**Gamora- Game**

Zoe Saldana's Gamora was good, but I never really believed she was any more competent in combat than anyone else, and her general lack of social awareness didn't really let me believe ""assassin"". The game version is super nimble, and situationally outshines Drax, which really gives her a lot more value. I also like that the game iteration has her own hobbies and interests outside of the Guardians and the bad guy. It feels like a midpoint, movie Gamora felt like we got the good development offscreen.

**Rocket- Movie**

They're essentially the same character, but I like movie Rocket because his relationship with Yondu was very fun to watch in GOTG2. Game Rocket doesn't seem to have many friends.

**Groot- Movie**

Again, basically identical. Big selfless tree guy only rocket can understand, but GOTG gave Groot some really fun moments. I think teenage Groot in Infinity war kind of sucked though.

Film/Television,False,"After watching Marvel Studios’ Black Widow (2021), I just felt that it was fine but not memorable what so ever, because it felt way too safe in some regards and never tapped into the inner psyche of Natasha Romanoff and was just a set up for Yelena Belova. After I watched the ‘Assembled’ documentary about the film, I can tell Cate Shortland and her team behind-the-scenes tried to experiment and tell a deeper story, but with Disney on their side, they probably weren’t gonna let that happen too often.

I decided to read a huge collection of Black Widow’s classic comic book appearances, then a thought was going through my mind. As time flew by, my thought grew bigger as I read through the Waid run and the Edmonson run of her solo comic series, and I’ve made my conclusion of what the character to me is.

To me, Black Widow is just a persona, NOT who Natasha really is. I think Natasha is a tortured and abused character that is filled with rage and sadness. She was brainwashed as a girl to become a trained killer, and is psychologically decaying. She’s a character I love, however, because even though she’s extremely flawed and problematic in some ways, she is undoubtedly a superhero because of the choices she makes and the inner moral she encompasses.

To me, that’s the story the true comic book fans deserve to see on the big screen.

So, I have a fanatic pitch that might be hit or miss for most, but it’s my ideal Black Widow film I would love to see made one day. I think this film should be a deep, realistic, violent and gritty R-rated Batman-like take on the Black Widow character that’s set in the noir tone of Reeves’ upcoming ‘The Batman’. It should also revolve around the themes of insanity, fear and greed.

The iteration goes… a corrupt billionaire by the moniker of Doctor Midas has been released from prison and is hiring a sadistic assassin Maki Matsumoto who is known to never miss her target, to kill the hero who put her behind bars, the Black Widow. After two years after retiring from the Avengers Initiative, Natasha Romanoff leaves her disturbing memories of the Red Room program behind her and is working closely with S.H.I.E.L.D.’s Nick Fury and Maria Hill as they complete risky espionage missions around the world. However, Natasha decides to build her persona and return as the Black Widow solo in order to track down and terminate Maki and Midas in the name of justice. A light-hearted mercenary who was a rejected member of the Avengers, Gustav Brandt decides to be her undercover ally, and Maki will test Midas’ patience in becoming her lethal weapon. In this dark and gritty tale of rivalry, trauma and vigilantism, Natasha will have to go back to her past to become something that we’ve never seen before.

Also, small addition that you can be open to disagree and ignore, but I think Emily Blunt would be perfect as Natasha in this iteration.",Marvel,I’d love to see a dark Black Widow film in the style of Matt Reeves’ The Batman!

Film/Television,False,"I think Sue will be hard to adapt, in early comics she is very passive, tender, caring and loving like the majority of the female characters of the time and was quite useless, as the comics moved on she became more confident and determinade and powerfull but the feminine and caring side of the character was still very present. However recent comics have made her everything but passive, she is still very caring for others but now is more erratic, emotional and violent and to be honest quite inmature, I think it will be hard for the movie makers to give her consistent character traits considering how much her personality has changed.

I think her best moment in recent years was in her own issue “Invisible Woman” she was very clever in this, but still has some problems. This might sound very specific but my favorite personality of her was in Fantastic Four issue 266, in this issue we are told of an story were Sue fought A mind controlled Thing, in this comic she was very caring, clever, strong and feminine all at the same time, she talks first rather than just straight up fight (something she does a lot in recent comics) and while is fighting her friend she knows she has to be strong despite not wanting to hurt him, and in top of that her sense of humor is shown, movie makes should just copy that sue.",Marvel,I think the Invisible Woman will be every hard to adapt in the big screen in incoming projects due to her changes over time

Up first, Iron Man!

**Iron Man, Vol. 1**

## Iron Man is Born!

*Takes place in Summer 2011.*

**Anthony ""Tony"" Stark** (*McCaul Lombardi*) is the son of **Howard** (*TBD*) and **Maria Stark** (*TBD*). Tony used to attend school but after his mother passed away, Howard decided to keep him close. Staying isolated from school, Tony excelled in the corporate world, developing new technologies for Stark Industries. Around the age of 18, Tony and Howard's relationship had begun to deteriorate due to Howard being far too overbearing and demanding, during this time Tony met brilliant inventor **Josey Gardner** (*TBD*) and the two began a relationship. The two began dating and after Tony decided to strike out on his own, the two of them created JT Technologies in order for Tony to create his own independent wealth.

During this time away, Howard continued to pressure his son about returning to Stark Industries and on the morning of his 21st birthday he received a call regarding the death of Josey who had died in a plane crash. Devastated by her death, Tony began acting out until his father reached out to him and convinced him to return to Stark Industries and channel his emotions and grief into his work and throw himself into his inventions. Tony's first project involved the development of cutting edge nanotechnology.

Six months after returning, Howard Stark was found dead in his bed and Tony took full reins of Stark Industries. This led Tony down a dark path as he became a cynical, alcoholic womanizer becoming a worldwide celebrity and the world's third-richest man in just three years' time. Although he had numerous issues, he was also well-loved as he took Stark Industries from just a munitions company to multinational conglomerate with a range of interests covering virtually all types of contemporary scientific industry, and the leader at the cutting edge of electronics.

Accountant **Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts** (*TBD*) spotted an accounting error and rushed to inform her bosses, saving the company millions. Impressed by her skills and dedication he offered her the job of being his personal assistant to which she accepted. Pepper would handle the majority of the day-to-day operations for Tony. It's during this time that Tony meets actress **Joanna Nivena** (*Brooklyn Kelly*) and the two begin dating. Before heading off to deliver a military presentation, he proposes to Joanna who happily accepts his offer.

After delivering his presentation in Afghanistan he joins the convoy and begins to leave. On route, the convoy is ambushed, which kills his escorts and lodges shrapnel into his chest. He was then taken captive by **Wong-Chu** (*Johnny Trí Nguyễn*), a terrorist warlord exiled from Sin-Cong, and informed that within a week the shrapnel would penetrate his heart and kill him. Wong-Chu promises Stark that if he builds him a weapon, he will be allowed to undergo an operation to save his life and be released. Even though Tony knew he was lying, he agreed, hoping to gain time and access to tools.

Stark was given access to a small lab with another captive, scientist **Ho Yinsen** (*TBD*), whose work Stark had admired. With Yinsen acting as his assistant, Stark designed and built an electrically powered suit of armor with a pacemaker-like device that enabled Stark's heart to keep beating, the armor was also equipped with heavy offensive weaponry.

Donning the suit, Stark connects it to its power source, an electrical generator. Knowing that if they were found, all of their work would be for nothing, Yinsen sacrifices himself allowing Tony enough time to power up. After completing the charge, Stark fights and kills Wong-Chu's second-in-command **Raza Al-Abadi** (*Saif Al-Warith*), **Abu Bakar** (*TBD*) and many more as he makes his escape from the compound.

An injured Stark, with his armor in pieces, comes across injured marine **James Rhodes** (*Edwin Hodge*), whose helicopter had crashed and left him stranded. The two make their way to the FOB and make their return to the US.

After landing down in the US, Tony is greeted by his driver **Harold ""Happy"" Hogan** (*Chris Wood*) and Pepper as well an entourage of journalists, including one **Christine Everhart** (*Nadia Parkes*) who asks several uncomfortable questions while also revealing that weapons manufactured by Stark Industries have been sold to various terrorist groups across the Middle East, including the Ten Rings who used them in his kidnapping. Overcome by everything Tony stumbles and leaves without answering any questions.

Upon returning home, Tony is met by his fiancée Joanna Nivena and finds out that after months of hearing nothing she called off their engagement and chose to move on. He spends the next few days creating a more powerful node for his chest and with the help of Pepper is able to replace his original, telling her to discard it is irrelevant. He then asks her to call a press conference and while there he announces the immediate dissolution of the weapons division of Stark Industries (to the shock of everybody in attendance including **Obadiah Stane** (*TBD*), and proceeds to leave without taking questions. He retreats to his home where he begins to create and test a new version of his armor.

**Edwin Cord** (*Tom Hughes*), CEO of Cordco and his main rival, is awarded the contracts to supply weapons to the US Military.

Tony continues to test his suit and the press begin to echo sentiments about the mysterious sightings of an ""Iron Man"". SHIELD dispatches agents **Dennis Murray** (*Patrick Schwarzenegger*) and **James ""Jimmy"" Woo** (*Alex Landi*) to investigate the mysterious sightings and if they have a connection to the reappearance of Stark.

One of those affected by the dissolution of the arms division was **Mordecai Midas** (*Yannis Tsimitselis*), a brilliant scientist who had developed several prototypes of novel weapons. Feeling neglected and eager for revenge on his boss, he begins to spy on him at his mansion.

Upon returning from a test run, Tony sees a live news report that shows the Ten Rings have taken over the Middle Eastern town of Gulmira and Tony decides it's time to honor his promise to Yinsen. He arrives in Gulmira just in time to kill the terrorists and rescue the civilians. Unbeknownst to Tony, Wong-Chu is close by and swears revenge upon seeing the iron man.

Midas is still surveilling Tony when he discovers that his former employer is the mysterious ""iron man"" that has been seen in New York and recently in Gulmira. He meets with **Ahmed Abassi** (*Firass Dirani*), a Ten Rings operative living in New York and tells him he has information that his boss will be highly interested in, he knows who the ""iron man"" is but will only talk to him directly. Ahmed contacts Wong-Chu and tells him the situation and Wong-Chu replies that he is already on the way. When he arrives, he demands to know who the man in the suit is, Midas says he will tell him but he wants to be there when he kills him. Wong-Chu gleefully grins as the two shake hands.

Midas breaks into a Stark Industries weapons warehouse and steals technology that he uses to create two powerful exo-suits to which Wong-Chu and Ahmed take on the names of *White Pearl* and *Mauler*. Not knowing where Tony is, they launch an attack on Stark Tower that causes massive amounts of damage which kills many and injures even more. Tony receives a call from Pepper who is in the tower and Tony gets his suit and makes a beeline for the tower.

Tony confronts them and after a hard fight, is able to kill Ahmed and causes an energy overload in Wong-Chu's exo-suit, severely crippling him. Wong-Chu is taken into custody where he remains in a coma. The battle is captured by the press, and Iron Man becomes topic number one, specifically, his connection to Tony.

Mordecai makes contact with a member of the Ten Rings and informs them their leader was defeated, he assures him that the Ten Rings are far from defeated and are only awaiting the word of their true leader, **The Mandarin** (*TBD*).

## Armor Wars

*Set five months later in Autumn 2011.*

Tony's double life as CEO of Stark Industries and Iron Man is going exceptionally well as Stark Industries stocks have never been higher and he felt he was making a difference as Iron Man. However, things begin to change when a mysterious figure known as the well-known industrial spy **Spymaster** (*TBD*) breaks in and steals designs of his suits.

He begins to investigate but is forced to table it when an armored terrorist attacks the UN headquarters. Iron Man confronts the terrorist who reveals himself to be the Titanium Man. The two engage in an exhausting fight and because of some recent upgrades and his quick wits, Tony is able to defeat him. Just then, **Nick Fury** (*Idris Elba*) arrives with a retinue of agents and reveals that he is the director of SHIELD, an organization authorized by the UN that specializes in combating international terrorism and more recently, superhuman threats and tells Tony the theft of his designs is a high priority for them. He also informs him that the Titanium Man's real name is **Boris Bullski** (*TBD*) who belonged to a Russian terrorist organization but he wasn't the one responsible for stealing the designs.

Tony realizes the repercussions that will come with criminals gaining access to his designs and so he vows to destroy them all and declares the Armor Wars in effect. Tony soon meets SHIELD scientist **Vernon Van Dyne** (*TBD*), who along with his lab partner **Henry ""Hank"" Pym** (*Paul Kelly*) help Tony upgrade his armor with special repulsor rays based on research the two had been conducting.

SHIELD assigns agent **Phil Coulson** (*TBD*) to join Tony in his war, who is apprehensive about having a government official watching his every move. While investigating, someone attempts to assassinate Tony, who is hit twice, once in the shoulder and once in the arm. Phil quickly jumps into action and is able to catch the shooter, showing his worth and gaining Tony's respect. The shooter turns out to be an ex-girlfriend named **Kathleen Dare** (*TBD*) who wanted revenge due to his rejection. She tells them a woman named **Justine Hammer** (*TBD*) supplied her with everything she would need to take him out. Kathleen is arrested and taken into custody by SHIELD.

Meanwhile, the United States government has had enough of Iron Man inserting himself where he doesn't belong and they commission Cordco to create an armor in order to dispose of him. They send Senator **Paul Boynton** (*TBD*) and General **James Meade** (*TBD*) to supervise. The suit is built by Dr. **Henry James Abrams** (*TBD*) and Army pilot **Jack Taggert** (*TBD*) is chosen as the test pilot. The armor is then baptized as *Firepower*.

Tony realizes he's going to need help from someone he knows and trusts so he contacts James Rhodes, as the two had remained in contact and became good friends. He reveals he is Iron Man and that he needs his help for the fight ahead and just as he is about to go into why Tony needs him, Rhodes puts his hand up to silence him and simply asks which one is his. Tony states that none and pivots around to reveal the War Machine armor, an armor he made specifically for him. Tony gives him a crash course in how to operate the armor and then the two head for the address provided by Kathleen Dare, an industrial complex in Flushing, New York.

After arriving at the complex it is revealed the mastermind behind everything is failed CEO Justine Hammer, who seeks to impose herself on companies Stark Industries or Cordco. Justine reveals her creations: two armors whose main function is steel whips that expel electricity, worn by hired guns **Leeann Foreman** (*TBD*) and **Mark Scarlotti** (*TBD*).

Tony doesn't wait for Justine to finish her monologue and instead attacks Scarlotti slamming him into a wall. Leeann strikes first against Rhodes and continues to batter him as he is still new to the armor, Tony attempts to help but is caught and knocked down. Scarlotti extends his whip towards Tony's head and just as it almost connects he counters by grabbing the whip and wrapping it around Scarlotti's arm tearing off both the suit and his physical arm. While Foreman continues to strike Rhodes she is quickly distracted by Tony and Scarlotti which gives Rhodes enough time to kick her leg out and hit her with a missile that sends her flying.

Just as it looks like Iron Man and War Machine are winning, Firepower arrives and Justine reveals that Jack Taggert actually works for her and he joins the fight. It's a grueling fight that is almost won by Firepower until Iron Man uses his new cannons to turn the tide and War Machine finishes him off, although Rhodes is severely injured and his armor badly damaged. Justine Hammer is taken into SHIELD custody and Tony is able to recover his designs but is not able to quell the controversy that arises due to the appearances of the mechanized villains.

Fury, Coulson, Van Dyne and Pym are back at SHIELD HQ discussing recent events when Vernon states that he and Pym must double their efforts in their research of the quantum particles, as they could be of great use to them in this new era.

Despite some of their obscureness (with probably the exception of Squirrel Girl), most of them can be identified as;

Captain Ultra

Frog-Man

Texas Twister

Squirrel Girl

Flatman

and of course the more well-know hero and the one who actually got accepted; She-Hulk

Then there's the guy with the helmet, who just does those kung-fu moves and Reed asks if he doesn't have powers.

Who exactly was that? Was it some super-duper obscure character, or was it just some random joke character the crew behind the episode/show made up?",Marvel,A question regarding an episode of Fantastic Four: World's Greatest Heroes
Comics ,False,"It's been awhile since I've read a comic, but I really wanna get back into it. Looking for some really good spiderman runs, I have a couple issues of the post superior spiderman run with Dan slott when Peter first returns but honestly it doesn't really do much for me other than spiderverse of course. Any suggestions from anyone? I've heard alot about ultimate spiderman thoughts on that would be appreciated aswell. Thanks!",Marvel,Spiderman recommendations?
Film/Television,False,It has Spider-Man and everything that was in the trailers,Marvel,Spider-Man Spoilers
Games,False,With the rumors that NetherRealm is developing a Marvel fighting game similar to Injustice what characters and storyline would you like? According to the rumor it's gonna be based of World War Hulk.,Marvel,A Marvel fighting game made by NetherRealm
Film/Television,False,"Spoiler warning! Now that the MCU has received it's very own piece of Venom symbiote via the multiverse crossover, who should become it's new host? A more evil version of Eddy Brock, or Mac Gargan? Personally i think the latter is a better choice for a villain Venom, as we already have a anti hero version with Eddy Brock. Plus the Gargan character is already present in the MCU.",Marvel,Who should be MCU Venom?
Film/Television,False,"Yesterday I watched the new spiderman in the cinema and shortly after the start there was a scene which was quite short but confused me a little.

 Spoiler: &gt;! The agent from the damag controll department mentioned that Nick Fury was missing since 5 year and the snap of Thanos. Which seems weird to me in hindsight of far from home. Could someone please explain this to me? Is this a foreshadowing for something or linked to another movie I didnt watch? !&lt;",Marvel,I have a question about Spiderman NWH. Spoiler and the question should also be in the spoiler tag and only visible if you click it.
Other,False,"Speaking from a tactical standpoint, wouldn’t it make more sense to have her catsuit zipped up all the way like in the comics? Or at least zip it up when she’s on a mission?",Marvel,"In the MCU, how come Black Widow always has her catsuit unzipped down to the bottom of her neck?"
Other,False,Since we know the multiverse can be opened technically any character that died can come back  meaning that tony could come back  and the avengers can be formed again(probably not I just thought of this and I probably wrong),Marvel,Anybody can come back
Comics ,False,"So it's been a while since I read comics, if I want to get into the modern/current comics of these characters, what would be a good jumping on point?
From what I understand, Donny Cates's run on Venom seems like a good place to start?
I'd really appreciate recommendations for spidey and venom respectively",Marvel,"Spider-Man, Venom comics jumping on points?"
Other,False,"I think that in every film when he grabs something with his web, he doesnt pull it just retracts? Are his webshooters retractable? Also if he does pull, what happens to the web that was used, it just disappears?",Marvel,I really dont understand spidermans webshooters
Film/Television,False,Couldn't they get help from tony for eva or avengers when fighting hydra god inhuman etc,Marvel,WTF were avengers doing when Agents of shield were fighting eva or inhumans ?
Film/Television,False,"Not sure where to post this, I’ve tried googling without seeing the same question. In Spider-Man NWH, there’s that moment on the roof where he meets the other spideys. Tom’s Spider-Man basically says he’s f-d up and eventually goes on to quote his aunt’s dying words. They all chime in to basically say they all have heard that quote from either uncle Ben/Aunt May. They’re all drawn in as this is like the reassuring moment in the movie to the Spideys (and the audience) that he’s not a f-up, but that he’s basically on the route to becoming a fully realized Spider-Man as that’s one of the keys that defines all Peter Parker’s and drives their heroism. My question is, does this mean Tom’s Peter Parker was meant to break the laws of the multiverse? As we learned in Loki, there is a sacred timeline and all nexus events that could possibly branch into another timeline are snuffed out to basically avoid a multiverse. But even if there were alternate timelines, there is still the governing sacred timeline where events are always supposed to happen the way they do. Not sure where I’m going with this, but interested in your thoughts on if you think this was planned, a plot hole, etc!",Marvel,"Spider-Man NWH question! Don’t open if you haven’t seen it or the Loki series! Potential plot hole, or was this on purpose?"
Other,False,Love the character and hoping to get into his comics a bit more,Marvel,What’s the best Miles morales comic?
Comics ,False,"So I was going through the Complete Marvel Reading Order Guider by Comicbook Herald, in that, they have said to read Inhumans, then Deadpool Classic Vol.2 to 5, then Black Panther. Can anyone tell me why is it so random?",Marvel,New to comics
Other,False,"I don’t understand what the difference between xmen and regular superhero’s are. 

The xmen are treated like outcasts in society but superhero’s are praised. I’m sure there’s an obvious answer so if someone can help my brain be less small, I’d appreciate it.",Marvel,Gonna sound pretty dumb but I’m a noob
Comics ,False,I have been keeping up but these events are a mystery to me.,Marvel,"Avengers (2018-) Vol.9, intro to Issue #46 mentioned Mephisto and Coulson facing the avengers and an update on the star brand child. What issues do these events happen in?"

Other,False,"Hey everybody, I’ve really wanted a group of people to talk about marvel with lately and have had no luck so I was wondering if anyone wanted to join this server I made. Or at least give it a try. I also need help modding it and such I’ve never made a server before.[the discord server](https://discord.gg/Bepdsgew)",Marvel,Marvel Social Discord
Comics ,False,I was wondering where do i start reading secret wars and if so can I a list on what to read after thank you,Marvel,Hey I’m a little new to reading comics
Other,False,"In my case, it was through the Marvel VS Capcom fighting game series (more specifically, Ultimate Marvel VS Capcom 3). From there, I began to dive in this amazing Multiverse. The only thing I regret was not getting to know it sooner.",Marvel,How were you introduced to the Marvel Universe?
Comics ,False,"I don't read the comics so I was curious, has there been any noticeable change in the comic books in response to the popularization of the MCU?",Marvel,Have you noticed a change in style/direction in the comics since the MCU explosion?
Comics ,False,"•X-Men

•Fantastic Four

•Avengers",Marvel,"Of the 3 teams listed below, which one battles the best villains?"
Comics ,False,"Like Thing and Agent Venom, who is another character you'd think would be a great addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy?",Marvel,Who is a Marvel character that would be a great addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy?
Other,False,"Hey guys, I love the F4 and it seems Marvel is having more trouble making people love them and I think it's because they don't need their own movie to be cool a lo Dr. Strange. I mean the dudes been in every movie except his own and people love him innit?

OK so here is all that needs to happen for everyone to love F4.


1 - Next time Hulk goes HULK mode make it so he goes more than usual crazy because it's been so long since he let it consume him.

2 - Have him easily beat some B listers pretty bad, War-Machine, Mantis and maybe Bucky. Make is so HULK is about the give the final shot to one of them.

3 - ""It's clobbering time"" boom, amazing introduction, everyone knows who it is, everyones on their side off the bat and now you can't wait until the other three show up sometime during the movie.

Thoughts?",Marvel,Solving Marvel's Fantastic 4's problem in three easy steps.
Film/Television,False,"So, in the MCU at least, it seems time travel works the following way: 

&gt;If you travel back in time, you do not wind up in your own past. Instead, you create a new timeline branching off from the moment in time you arrived at.

It seems like different universes within the multiverse are inspired by the multiple universes theory in quantum mechanics:

&gt;There's infinitely many universes, each one encompassing its own scenario of how things could have played out. 

Now, with the TV series Loki seems to be concerned with time, given the TVA stands for ""Time Variance  Authority"" and given that everything is taking place within ""The Sacred Timeline"". However, the content of the series seems to really be concerned with the restriction of universe propagation. 

The Sacred Timeline is a bundle of universes that kept in-line through the pruning of the TVA. Whenever a series of quantum events with rippling effects great enough to cause a sufficient ""time variance"", the TVA shows up to prune. One such series of quantum event could be the replacement of a y chromosome for an x chromosome, as in Sylvie's case. Then, the variance picks up exponentially as the differences accumulate from that point on. Following the multiple universes theory, every such quantum event leads to the creation of a different universe within the multiverse. The TVA isn't there to stop every such creation, they're simply there to erase the ones that veer too far off from the central narrative of the so-called Sacred Timeline. 

However, it's doesn't seem like a timeline at all. It seems more like a subset of universes within a multiverse that's being strangled by Kang; strangled into fitting within the confines of this subset. The Sacred Timeline should have been called The Sacred Subset. In fact, it's actually quite similar to the concept in Rick and Morty; the central curve is just a subset of universes within the multiverse that all follow a certain format, that format being that Rick must be the smartest man in the universe. The difference is that the central curve is a subset of universes isolated from the rest of the multiverse, presumably meaning that no multiversal travel into or out of that central curve is possible. 

No, the way I've conceptualized the co-existence of multiple universes and multiple timelines is this: the multiverse is a collection of universes. A universe is a collection of timelines; if there's more than one timeline, then time travel has happened (time travel different than the one we're already performing constantly by going forward in time). 

So, it follows from this understanding that when the Avengers went back in time in Endgame, they never left Earth 199999. They simply created new timelines within the universe of Earth 199999. However, had they somehow travelled to e.g. Sylvie's universe, then they'd be in a different universe than Earth 199999. 

Is this understanding correct? If so, why was it called the TVA and Sacred Timeline? If not, what is correct?",Marvel,Does time travel in Marvel just mean going to different universes within the multiverse?
Comics ,False,"Are there any subscription services I can pay for that deliver physical copies to my home? I recently moved, and what was my local comic book shop is now 30min away from me. It wasn’t a problem before because I could drive down real quick on Wednesday mornings, but now it’s a lot more tedious. Any suggestions help. Thanks everybody!",Marvel,Quick Question!
Other,False,I’ve noticed that in most of BW’s appearances in the comics her catsuit is fully zipped up all the way (with a few exceptions here and there) but in media such as the MCU and a few other comics she’s almost always seen with her catsuit unzipped down to the bottom of her neck. It’s a small detail but I wonder which do you prefer?,Marvel,"In terms of design, do you prefer Black Widows catsuit to be fully zipped up or unzipped to the bottom of her neck?"
Other,False,A big battle ensues with monsters encircling Doctor Strange and Co. across the multiverse then BOOM an explosion destroys all the enemies. (Enemy by Imagine Dragons starts playing) a man is seen in a dust cloud with what appears to be an iron man suit. His face is yet to show. Slowly he comes down lightening the power of his suit. The dust settles. Pan to his face. “Hey everyone this is Ryan Reynolds from the hit move “Free Guy (2020)” movie ends as the new iron man is introduced.,Marvel,What I hope happens in Doctor Strange: M.O.M.
Film/Television,False,Rogue had the ability to take another users life force / powers by the touch of her hand. When ever she touched someone she could drain them until death. If she touched someone with powers she’d just end up taking their powers for a specified amount of time.,Marvel,Couldn’t Rogue from the X-men universe beat Thanos?
Comics ,False,"So I've been binging some X-Men comics, and I'm wondering who you guys think is underrated in terms of mutants, and why you think that?",Marvel,Who is the most underrated mutant in the Marvel universe?
Comics ,False," So when I was a kid I really loved watching superhero tv shows. The first one I ever watched was the 1990s Batman the Animated tv series (I wanted to become a detective because of Batman).

In Highschool I found an incredible hulk comic book in the library and I was really enamored with it, but the other kids would pick on me for reading it; saying things like ""comic books are for little kids"". I stopped reading it because I didn't want the other kids to make fun of me and I just relegated myself to the movies (Iron Man 1 had just come out around this time and I loved it).

For my 20th birthday, My cousin got me Iron Man Vol 4 issue #1. I was really thrilled and I decided after that day, I would get back into comics. I first started by paying an absurdly ridiculous subscription with Marvel to get Iron Man comics shipped to my house... It never even crossed my mind to go to a comic book store (I was an idiot at 20).

Whelp I canceled my subscription and I was going to try my hand at a comic book store in my area. As silly as it sounds, I actually got the impression that most comic book store owners we're going to be like Comic book guy from the Simpsons and this made me feel anxious, like I was going to get judged for liking comic books at my age. So I went to my local store and I was anxious right off the bat. I had no idea what I was doing or what to look for. I was just looking at books and keeping to myself, trying very hard not to look like a fool. The owner of the store, Rob, came up to me and asked me if I needed help. I told him that I really wanted to get into some more Iron Man. To my surprise he took time out to help me find the current run on Iron Man and he taught me what to look out for when I was interested in more issues.

After that day I would go back to the comic book store and I became a frequent customer. I would take the comics I got and I would read them at work and they helped me get past my long shifts; I would take them with my to college and read in my free time; I found friends who were also into comic books. I would hangout with Rob on Wednesdays (that's when the new comics came out) and we would just talk for a little while about what we liked and disliked about the newer releases. I even befriended his niece who also worked at the store and we're great friends even to this day.

Through Rob I felt like I could be more like the person I wanted to be without fear of persecution. I even gained the confidence to go to Anime and Comic conventions.

Sadly Rob passed away in 2016 and the store shutdown (it's now a payday loan company that owns the building). I really wish I could tell him how much he changed my life and how grateful I am that he helped a 20 year old boy to find himself.

I've posted on here before about my struggles with liking myself... but I can say wholeheartedly that the side of me that is so excited and passionate about comics, is the side of me I love the most.

Today I am 30 years old and I am still very much into comics. I have started my own comic book reading club on Mondays and I invite friends to join me as we read comic books together. I am also looking into starting a comic book podcast where I invite people who are curious about their favourite comic book characters.

I know this was a really long story but I just wanted to share it.",Marvel,Comic books saved my life
Film/Television,False,"So i saw a tiktok saying which Marvel character could easily beat Thanos even with the 6 stones. And he said The Living Tribunal and Knull. 

I did some research and they are strong but i think im just touching the iceberg. 

Which movies in what order should i watch to get a good understanding of the characters and their powers? 
(I have watched the endgame and infinity war)",Marvel,"Im new to Marvel, which movies to watch in which order?"
Comics ,False,"I saw online while doing research into Toxin that there’s a comic series where Eddie takes on all the symbiotes. I looked it up and couldn’t find it, but I want to read it. Can you guys tell me what it’s called and/or where to find it?",Marvel,Eddie Brock Vs. All Symbiotes Comic Series
Comics ,False,"What are some of the new heroes running around that have as much potential as some of the classic heroes? Personally I can’t wait to see more of Mosaic and Miss America, but I’m not too well versed in the comics to have an informed enough opinion. 

Also I’m counting “new” as since the turn of the millennia.",Marvel,What new comic heroes are you excited to see more of?
Comics ,False,"I want to get more into the character as I've been seeing a lot of people wanting the character in the MCU and I always love exploring non-American superheroes. So I've been wondering about Brian Braddock.

We know Captain America represents the best of America's ideals. The idea of trust in your fellow man, defending the little guy, freedom of rights. He embodies what America seeks to be.

So what does Captain Britain represent in that case? What would the ideals of Britain be?",Marvel,"If Captain America represents American values, what would you say Captain Britain represents?"
Other,False,"It's like, I'm waiting for ages to see Tobey &amp; Andrew's Spidey posters on the official handles of MCU, any lead when they are gonna post it?",Marvel,When they are gonna show us the BTS or Posters of Tobey or Andrew's Spidey?
Comics ,False,"So i’ve been catching up on her ongoing, and that seems to draw heavily from the spider-woman: origins (2006?). that storyline goes with her mom being hit with radiation while pregnant with her instead of the radiation exposure making her i’ll. so we know that she had some in-utero issues then got sicker and her sad experimented on her with the spider serum. but it seemed like she was fine for a few years before she ended up getting sick so i’m not sure where that came from. and then did her dad’s serum that gave her the spider powers actually fix her because she ended up with high evolutionary, so was it him who fixed her?",Marvel,Spider-woman / Jessica Drew questions
Comics ,False,"I have been reading some comics from the late 1980s and I keep seeing advertisements for something called the New Universe. What was it? Could someone give the cliffnotes, or a link to an article about it please and thank you?",Marvel,"What Was ""New Universe?"""

Film/Television,False,"Hi, I have recently started rewatching all of the MCU movies, also with the intention of watching the movies I haven't watched, and while starting The Incredible Hulk (2008) I noticed that it seems like Bruce Banner in this movie already had the accident that made him the Hulk, so I was thinking: do I need to watch the 2003 movie (even though I don't think they are connected) in order to see the origins of the character? Because I would really like to see how it was before the accident, but if the 2003 movie is not correlated to this one it might be a waste of time (I've also heard many people didn't like this old movie so idk)

Other,False,"Hey guy's,

Ok, so I have no idea whether this sounds horrible or not but I had to write it down somewhere. A marvel movie where for whatever reason, somebody from OUR earth (where its all just storys), is pulled into the marvel world (real). Like imagine them telling everyone  how they are In our world. Or what happens to them in the future. I know it probably causes alot of problems with the plot but after watching no way home its fun to think about. They could be the only person who knows Peter Parker after everyones memory of him is erased; creating a friendship between them maybe. Idk maybe it's dumb but I had to tell somebody about it (I doubt I'm the first person to come up with it).",Marvel,Movie idea with our own world

Comics ,False,"Looking for comics with one timeline and no multiverse BS. Like the MCU was before they started ruining it with the Multiverse?

Like in a shounen manga you’re only dealing with the one version of the characters so you always know their powers and they have training arcs to discover new abilities.

Film/Television,False,"I just saw Spider-Man: No Way Home. I liked it overall. The jokes were pretty terrible and their were some plot-holes, but it was an enjoyable movie. What I definitely didn’t like was the ending. Putting aside the aforementioned plot-holes for the time being, I’d like to question the implications. If this movie is to be believed, than every person in Earth-199999, and every person in every Marvel universe that knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man will now forget Peter Parker entirely. There is no way this is going to hold. First of all, the movie should not be ruining stories going on in different universes just so it can have a sappy ending. Second of all, no way this is going to hold for more then 5 seconds. There have probably already been comics published since the movie came out where people who know Peter Parker is Spider-Man know who Peter Parker is. I said I wouldn’t talk about plot-holes, but on top of that the ending wasn’t even necessary to begin with. Am I missing something? Could anyone who understood this better help me out here.

P.S. 

Tom Hardy’s Venom didn’t know Peter Parker is Spider-Man so how did he get warped?

Wouldn’t it take like half a day for someone to stumble onto a week-old newspaper that say PETER PARKER IS SPIDER-MAN, and his identity would be out again?

&gt;!The explanation given for Doctor Strange's botched spell is that it pulled every character who knew Spiderman was Peter Parker. Ok that makes sense. Why was Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock pulled in?

Comics ,False,"Now I know this has probably been posted countless times, but I really have no idea where to start. I've tried reading some of the 80's comics of various characters, but the art style of that era really isn't my thing at all.

So I'm looking for anything from the 90s onwards that will introduce me to events and characters (not just from X-men) and aren't going to make me feel lost every few issues.

Some characters and teams I'm interested in are:
The X-Men
Spiderman
Moon Knight 
Blade
X-Force
Dr Doom

Film/Television,False,"Ned was Peter’s man in the chain. His best friend. The person who was there to help Peter before anyone else. And in an instant Peter decided to erase all of that &amp; the many years of friendship that came before it. He will feel betrayed as he begins to regain his memories, and his resentment for his former best friend will begin him on a villainous path. There will inevitably be quips about “who’s smarter now” once Ned finishes his time at MIT (if he doesn’t drop out to become a villain). 

Presumably, MJ and Ned remember helping Spider-Man, they just don’t remember that Peter is Spider-Man. Otherwise, being stuck on an island after the spell was cast &amp; you’re surrounded by wreckage from a massive fight might raise some questions. 

Now, we know Spider-Man in the main MCU doesn’t have a green goblin, I.e. it’s unlikely he will turn into the Hob Goblin. And Ned Leeds in the comics does not use magic. So I think we can mix that idea that his MCU character will be based on his comic origins. 

In this version of the MCU, Ned’s family is said to have magic- which is why it was so easy for him to open portals. It is honestly an impressive feat, because he did it with ease that not even Strange had, and without an actual magical mentor like the Ancient One. 

That said, I think we should examine the conditions of the MCU directly after FFH. Ned had seen Mysterio’s rant about Spider-Man but doesn’t know it was Peter. After finding out he is Peter, Ned will start to believe what Mysterio said about how dangerous Peter is. He will take up the mantle of Mysterio, but will use magic and technology rather than just technology.

He will align himself with Mordo, and will become a true threat in the MCU.",Marvel,How Ned’s character will play out in the MCU (NWH spoilers)

But I think Spider-Man No Way Home actually pointed out why he's so different from the comic books &amp; actually made a lot of sense doing so.

One of the biggest gripes I've heard about film Venom is ""he's not scary enough.  Where's all the rage?  Why is he so silly?""  First off, the scary rage filled Venom from the comics is that way for a clear reason &amp; you're forgetting all about it.  In the comics, what made the symbiote so angry was the fact that it was rejected by Spider-Man (and it was driven a little crazy when it first bonded with Deadpool for a few seconds right before Spider-Man bonded with it).  The symbiote was so enamored with Peter Parker that Peter once defused a bout with Venom by [offering himself up to the symbiote](https://preview.redd.it/dq7kborm7iq21.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=77bfd65e1c18f16b71ca179835335e5a5715d4dc).  Since No Way Home clarified that, &gt;!in the Venom film universe, NONE of the superheroes from the MCU exist (on account of the scene at the bar where the bartender is explaining the history of the MCU superheroes &amp; Eddie is just confounded about all of it)!&lt;.  So the symbiote never met Peter.  Never got rejected.  Never met Deadpool either, so it wasn't driven a little crazy first.

Why is he so silly?  Well, tbh, the comic books did have [jokey comments](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/vv0BVIM8sEYdLDiNjL2IelhyMHpOqqR4-Af055ZwSVjXcDh2EfDYxntYrmYvdNC2PyDmfpweheC6=s1600) &amp; [quips](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-cb61d5b2b6f8b2b19c49d47c1d8263c5).  While, yes, he was definitely scary in the comics, film Venom does kill people &amp; talk about eating their brains &amp; whatnot ([like in the comics](https://static2.cbrimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/hunger-venom-2.jpg?q=50&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=740&amp;h=1123&amp;dpr=1.5)).

Film/Television,False,"My theory is that the director/writers/etc wanted to use the Shadow King instead of Apocalypse, but couldn't because he was going to be the main villain in Legion (which I assume was being filmed/written around the same time, since it was released in 2017, and X-Men: Apocalypse was released in 2016). 

There are lots of elements of X-Men: Apocalypse that don't quite fit. First, Storm is introduced. While this is a minor detail, it's important to mention that Storm is present in Charles Xavier's first meeting with the Shadow King in the comics, while she has never been a major player in most arcs involving Apocalypse. 

Second, a major part of the finale was a battle on the astral plane between Xavier and Apocalypse (which, admittedly, was quite interesting to watch). However, this seems more like Shadow King, who has had many battles on the astral plane in the comics, especially his first notable one, which is with Xavier. From what I've read, Apocalypse usually doesn't do this sort of conflict.

Film/Television,False,"And a lot of people seem to think. I believe that this is set in the Garfield universe. Some people think it's set in the MCU because of the. ""Murderer"" on the Spider-Man picture. There are a few reasons why I believe it's in the Garfield universe. To me the most telling is the picture we saw on the bus that says "" where is Spider-Man?"" This obviously takes place during the exact same time as NWH.  Spider-Man is missing because he's now in Tom Holland's universe. The murderer poster can also easily be explained by Andrew Garfield's story about being filled with rage and not pulling his punches. I think having venom, Morbius and the rest of the sinister six exist in the Garfield universe would be perfect. Perfect. It would make his comment about being lame and not fighting as tough of villains as the other two laughable in retrospect. I could see Sony agreeing to let Tom Holland stay in the MCU if marvel helped reboot their own concurrent Spider-Verse. Venom, Morbius  and all those other villain movies they've been making feel incomplete because they're missing Spider-Man. This gives them and easy way to have Spider-Man and their movies who is different than the MCU.   It's a win-win. Tom Holland gets to stay in the MCU and the spider verse gets that marvel bump.  I really hope that this is the case because I would love to see Andrew Garfield get to bring his character back and do it justice all the while giving the spider verse feelings in actual Spider-Man.

Comics ,False,"Quick question I had about in universe logic: 
Why don’t heroes like the avengers help out during any huge mutant attacks like sentinel attacks or the genosha massacre? Is it ever addressed? Cause it makes the avengers look like they’re part of the problem. 

I know that out of universe it’s because having the avengers help out would defeat the purpose of the x-men comics. But like I would love to see Magneto calling out Captain America for not helping enough when lots of the crimes committed against mutants are with the express purpose of genocide against them.

Film/Television,False,"spoilers, i think? but today i watched endgame, and i also watched as Mjolnir goes through two time machines without returning. once when Thor makes sure hes still worthy and once when cap takes Mjolnir with him to return the stones, which means that he either dropped it off when he put the reality stone back, or (since he didnt actually know that Thor took it) he kept it with him, meaning that for a time between whenever he stayed to be with Peggy and 2013, there was two Mjolnirs, and no matter what he did with Mjolnir, there was also two Mjolnirs for the entire final battle of the movie with the alternate 2014 thanos. 

also Thor has Mjolnir in Thor: the dark world after the time travel stuff takes place chronologically, meaning either Steve put his Mjolnir back on Asgard when returning the reality stone (which isnt realistic since he wasnt aware Thor had taken it and likely neither did Thor realize he stole his own hammer) or in a scene we dont see in Thor: the dark world, Thor had to wait a damn long time for his hammer to fly from earth to him.",Marvel,Mjolnir shenanigans in endgame

 I feel like with his experience with both Supernatural (a show about magic, demons, and the occult) and The Boys (a superhero show) he could make one hell of a Disney plus show. they could make a 8 to even 13 episode series in which they fight the occult (hello this is the plot of supernatural) leading up to Mephisto and Lilith in the final battle. the alternate members of the team could also make cameos. I'd like them to lean in to the horror aspect 100%, and make this as gory as possible.

1. In Far From Home Nick Fury is impersonated by skrulls while Fury is off-earth. In No Way Home it is stated hat Nick Fury is off-earth and thus cannot back Peters perspective up. Why do the skrulls try to get Peter to join the fight / go to Berlin etc. (in Far From Home), why do they impersonate Fury when no one on earth expects them to (as they know Fury is off-earth), and if they are allowed to impersonate him, why can't they support Peter now? I just don't get that part at all.

2. Why is the reversal of the spell that everybody forgets Peter Parker? The original spell is (from my understanding) that everyone forgets that Peter Parker is Spiderman but it gets messed up and now beings that know Peter Parker is Spiderman are drawn to earth. Wouldn't it have been enough to just cast the original spell correctly this time?

Other,False,"This might be an unpopular opinion that draws a lot of hate, but I’ve been trying to pinpoint why the villains and fight scenes in the MCU overall underwhelm me. 

I’ve felt this way for a long time, but it was solidified when I watched Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy back after seeing No Way Home.

In those (albeit flawed) movies, there are some iconic moments, like Spider-Man flipping over the glider before it stabs the Goblin, and in the third where he slingshots Harry’s bomb back toward him. They happen so fast, but very cleanly and struck me just as much as when I first saw them years ago. 

I really can’t think of one single battle moment that stuck out to me in the MCU…I do think Bucky’s battle scenes are really well-done for some reason and I always enjoy watching those.

I think in the MCU there is just so much going on — like multiple characters fighting at once and chaotic CGI because of everyone’s grandiose superpowers.

I guess I’m wondering if anyone else feels this way, and if someone has an explanation for it (is it the editing style? particular directors? lazy villain stories?)…I just can’t exactly pinpoint it. Maybe it’s my nostalgia simply getting in the way.",Marvel,Underwhelmed with fight scenes

&amp;#x200B;

So, do you prefer having adaptations cover the original storylines as if they were taken out of the comics (ex: the X-men 90s cartoon), or taking more risks rielaborating the characters and situations to make a more unique story, as long as it is still good (ex: most of the MCU movies that are not origin stories)?",Marvel,Best way to adapt.

Is Gamora from 2014 that came to the future with Thanos still alive, or did she die in the end of Endgame?
I say that she's still alive, and that she's stuck in the present (her future), because they didn't show that she died when Tony snapped his fingers, and that I also believe that they will spend the next GotG movie looking for her. 
Also, I think that it will be a very weird thing to do - to just bring a character that had a very tragic death scene in the previous movie, and then just kill her again after the fight with Thanos.

My buddy says that Gamora is dead and gone, because when Star-Lord was looking for her on his monitor in the end of the movie, he couldn't find her.

Film/Television,False,Which way is the best for a first watch through of the marvel movies?,Marvel,Chronological order or release order?
Film/Television,False,"Let me start by saying that I 1,000% agree that Spider-Verse is a masterpiece. One of the greatest movies ever made. Yada yada yada.

I also am a massive proponent of animation in general. So many film snobs like to dismiss it and say it's just for kids. I have the utmost respect for it as an art form and as a storytelling medium. Probably moreso than any other, which is precisely why I think it's unfair that people tend to compare Spider-Verse to pretty much every other superhero movie -- the overwhelming majority of which are done in live-action. 

I often like to say that comparing animated films to live-action ones is like judging lunch by dessert standards. Like, at the end of the day, a salami sandwich and a piece of pie are both delicious food that I want to eat, but the way each of those things goes about *being* delicious food is different. 

At the end of the day, an animated movie and a live-action one are both movies that tell a visual story with characters and emotion, but too much of what either one is trying and able to achieve on the way to their destination is different. You judge animation in ways you wouldn't live-action and vice-versa. 

For example: You wouldn't really pay attention to the way something moves or emotes in live-action in the same way you would if it were animated. With live-action, you see something simple like a ball bouncing and it's just a ball bouncing. With animation, you can make the ball a whole character and have it bounce with a visible personality if you want, even though it's just a featureless sphere. You can get emotion and story out of things you just couldn't in live-action.

With animation you're only inhibited by the limits of your skill and imagination. You can literally do anything you can think of, move the camera in any manner, stretch or break the rules and logic of reality and perception in any way you want, make objects and characters look however you want with whatever shapes and aesthetic you want. It's like filmmaking with cheats on while also being 10 times harder and more time-consuming lol. You also have to literally create every single iota of the flick from scratch, which is not a thing in the alternative.

So often do I see people like, ""Spider-Verse is the best superhero/Spider-Man movie because it's the only one that actually looks like a comic book and it has the most unique visuals and blah blah blah."" Like, no shit. It's a cartoon where they can achieve all that to the level that they did. The only live-action movie that comes anywhere close is one of my favorites of all time, 'Scott Pilgrim vs. The World.' And I wouldn't compare that either because Spider-Verse does the it better because *of course it does.* It's animated. The medium perfectly lends itself to that type of thing in a way live-action simply cannot.

Nobody ever really compares The Incredibles or Big Hero 6 to the MCU, and yet I constantly see people kinda discrediting MCU fare to praise Spider-Verse. They're two different things.

Literally. I mean I always loved Marvel. My parents bought me a subscription to the Amazing Spider-Man before I could read. I just loved looking at the pictures... and when I got a little older, you I would count the minutes all week long to Saturday morning at 11a.m. when Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends came on TV. Actually, I loved all superheroes... I loved the Super Friends, and the Incredible Hulk Live action TV show, I played with all the toys, dressed up as Spidey for Halloween, etc. but I only began collecting comics after a random Saturday night in 1985. 

I lived in a really small town, like population 900, and every Saturday night all the old folks in town would get in line at the Five &amp; Dime to get the Sunday paper which came out Saturday evenings (don't ask me). My grandpa would never miss it, and I would tag along with him whenever I could. One Saturday, he was waiting in line and I was perusing the rotating comic book rack as usual. I always liked looking at the covers, but never wanted to buy one of these books, until I saw this one... Secret Wars #10.  

I knew who Dr. Doom was from all the cartoons I've watched over the years. I didn't know much about him, other than the basic detail that he was the most baddass villain in the Marvel Universe. My 11 year old mind could not grasp what could have possibly done this to him. Seeing him battered and bloody with his armor ripped to shreds was fascinating to me. I had to know. I begged my grandpa to buy me the book, and he did! 

Being issue #10 of a 12 issue limited series, I had no Idea what was going on, but I was hooked. I immediately began collecting Spider-Man comics again, and slowly began collecting all my favorite titles.... Captain America, Iron Man, FF, Daredevil, Hulk, Avengers,  and more... and when I was able, I went to the nearest comic book store and bought all the back issues of Secret Wars, which still remains one of my favorite Marvel tales to this day. 

Like everyone here, I'm sure, I absolutely love Marvel. I collected comics for about 10 years, and I've been to the theater to see every movie they've ever released. Now I'm teaching my kids to love Marvel as well... and I owe it all to this book.

Comics ,False,"I’ve just finished reading the 2013 Superior Spider-Man run, and absolutely loved it. Seeing a villain take on the responsibility of being Spider-Man in their own brutal way, slowly learning to respect the hardships of being a hero, everything about it is amazing.

I think it would be great to see a live-action version of this in the MCU, but my idea would be having the Vulture take over Spider-Man’s body instead of Doc Oc. This is because I don’t think it would make sense to bring Alfred Molina back, and his portrayal of Doc Oc wouldn’t be suited to being the Superior Spider-Man. In the Raimi films, Octavius is a good man driven mad by grief and the control of his robotic arms. However, in the comics, he is a bitter man who hates the world because of how cruelly he’s been treated by society, and only through being Spider-Man does he start to respect the value of human life.

The MCU Vulture may not have the intellect of Doc Oc, but he is still a calculating and cold villain with a good understanding of technology. Similar to the Earth-616 Doc Oc, he feels wronged by the world, and has grievances against its heroes (Iron Man for indirectly causing him to lose his livelihood, and Spider-Man for stopping his criminal exploits).

I could easily see the Vulture having a similar path to Otto’s if he became the Superior Spider-Man - at first dispensing justice brutally and lethally, with little thought for collateral damage, but as time went on beginning to shoulder the burden of being a hero, and learning to let go of his grudges.

Other,False,"Things I am assuming with this theory:

* The TVA has no interruptions in the events I describe other than the Loki scene with the tesseract at the start of the Loki series.
* Bruce Banner (Hulk) and his theory about time ""If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future, and your former present becomes the past, which can’t now be changed by your new future"" is not 100% true (will elaborate on this)
* Cap returns the stones at the exact moment they were taken from the past in Endgame.

Why (In my opinion) Bruce Banner's theory is wrong:

It is my belief that if you travel to the past and change anything then the future you will return to is not the same future you travelled from. This is somewhat seen in the film 'Back to the Future 2' where Marty and Doc travel back to a different past due to the sports almanac. This means that during Endgame where the avengers head back in time to get the stones they can't of changed anything else the future they returned to is different. This is not exactly true as cap and stark took pym particles from the lab and could of had unknown effects on the present timeline.

The stones and the events in end-game:

Near the start of the film we see thanos 'atomize' the stones, therefore destroying them in a sense, this future actually never happened, or is now discounted as past thanos was brought into the future and killed, so there was no thanos to 'atomize' them. This means the original 6 stones technically are destroyed, however with the events of Endgame the stones used by Stark to kill thanos and his army are returned and therefore will exist in present day MCU. This theory is best seen with a chronological explanation of each stone.

The time stone (probably one of the more complex ones):

This stone is held by the ancient one and given back by cap, where she presumably left the it in the eye of agamotto. This HAD to happen else the future would be changed into one where Dormamu won his conquest of Earth, due to the absence of the time stone. There are problems with this though as strange does not have the stone anymore, meaning one of three things: Strange used the stone to defeat Dormamu and someone else took it,  or strange got rid of it which unlike the previous version of the timeline before the changes in endgame he wouldn't have dome. This change could have occurred due to the stealing of pym particles or the fact that cap stayed (which would havve effected the timeline.)  Or someone other then strange used to stone to defeat dormamu and they have it present day (this doesn't explain why strange says in no way home &gt;!'I don't have the stone anymore' as he wouldn't of had it in the fist place !&lt;.)  Or Dormamu was defeated in some other fashion, which has the same complicated as possibility number 2. Either which one happened it means someone else has the time stone present day.

The power stone (simple):

It was returned to Morag where the events of Guardian of the Galaxy 1 played out to end up with the present say stone being kept in safe keeping by Nova Corps.

The space stone (tesseract):

Replaced in the exact same spot and would ultimately end up in one of two places. The vault of Asgard, which means it would have been on the 'asgardian colony ship' seen at the end of Thor Ragnarock (because Loki smuggled it on) which would have survived as thanos would not have killed them. Or be in an evidence locker or something tucked away on Earth (less exciting in all honesty)

The reality stone (simple again):

Presumably somehow injected into Jane and would likely end up in the hands of the collector.

The mind stone (kind of imperative):

The stone had to end up in the possession of Wolfgang von Strucker else Wanda's and Pietro's powers would not exist and vision would also would not of fused with JARVIS. Some implications of this not happening would be Hawkeye's death in Sokovia as Pietro wouldn't save him and what could be argued to be Ultron's victory.

In Loki, all the universes are arranged to follow 1 course of events aka 1 timeline aka the sacred timeline.

In endgame the avengers create new universes by going back in time but all of the universes end up folowing the course of events. except the loki one which the tva reset

Film/Television,False,"Slight Spoilers for Spider-Man: No way Home\

I love superhero movies and the genre, and I've been with the MCU since the beginning with Iron Man. Though my relationship with the MCU has been rocky recently. I've kind of lost my love for it due to it's, in my personal opinion, slow decline in quality recently. Struggling to convince myself to watch newer movies and hell I still haven't watched eternals.

After no way home I finally went ""Fuck it, I'll watch daredevil"" and I fucking loved it. It's honestly some of the best writing, and cinematography I've ever seen with Marvel. Take in mind I'm not the type to talk about Cinematography but man did this show have great shots. Personally better than most MCU movies and I have a very hard time seeing who thought canceling it was a good idea. With having finished it I thought to myself that if the MCU with how it is now were to make a daredevil movie or new show that they are more than likely to fuck it up. Now if they were to get the same folks who crafted the show then that would be fine. But if other directors/Screenwriters besides the Russo's were to handle these characters then I don't believe it would work. Seeing as how hawkeye's version of kingpin is just a huge disservice to the original version of the character. Turning him into a shell of his former self and making him more a dumb brute then the always 5 steps ahead Willie from the original show.

It's just the maturity and grit of the show is something only really matched by Winter Soldier and Infinity War. I just hate that they may tone them down too much. Now may they adapt them perfectly? Yes, but I just don't think it's high possibility. Hopefully they do because I hope for a world where they let the show continue somehow and make a season 4, but I don't know how that would work with Netflix. But I'm still definitely glad they let Charlie and Vincent reprise their roles and I can't wait to see them in more stuff. Anyways thanks for reading, and watch Daredevil because I highly recommend it.

**Part1**

Which is it?

&amp;#x200B;

A - NOT PURELY ARTIFICIAL - there is **indeed some** web or silk or something that comes out of them. but it doesn't really shoot out of their wrists. thus, they have these 'web shooters' to really extract stuff that comes out of them and then shoots web

B - PURELY ARTIFICIAL - there is **no such web or silk** that comes out of them. they just have spider-like abilities like sticking to wall, reflexes, jumping, strength, etc and so they have this idea, 'hey why don't i create this artificial web shooting thing where i get spider webs or silk or whatever from actual spiders? that'd be funny. then i'd be like a a full human-spider and stuff.'

&amp;#x200B;

C - other?

&amp;#x200B;

Based on what I've been reading it seems to be B and in fact tobey maguire is the odd 1 out in that the other 2 are actually what was happening in the comics. But if B then I don't really get this at all. They seem to basically have similar 'powers' to, say, Black Widow or someone, but now they have gadgets that shoot out sticky ropes. So what we ~~can just give~~(RIP) could've just given a web shooter to Black Widow? I think they could've come up with better things than a web shooter especially that their movies were 2012 onwards. Why actual spider silk/web? Why not like some really sticky rope or grappling hook or whatever?

If you haven’t heard by now , Sony is ALLEGEDLY eyeing Garfield for TASM3 . They are also allegedly courting Emma Stone to return( see links below )

Because of No way home , there has been this sudden resurgence in interest in Andrew Garfield as spiderman. There has been this huge campaign on social media for him to make a third movie and ALLEGEDLY sony is considering it.

Suddenly everybody ""really loved him as spiderman"" and he was their ""favorite"" and it was "" just bad writing.. while that may be true , I remember Andrew was definitely collateral damage in the critique ( we all
Know a bad movie can affect an actors career even if their acting was good ) . Recently I watched an interview where he even alluded that after Spiderman he didn't really have an audition for a while .  ( his next film project was approximately
Two years after in Silence and Hacksaw Ridge) . Now idk per se if it was definitely because of TASM, I’m simply speculating .


My opinion is If andrew is smart , he will STAY THE HELL AWAY from this franchise UNLESS , maybe it's to do a supporting / multi-spiderman role of some sort like he did in No Way Home. Returning to Spiderman as a continuation of hist first two movies is risky. The Spiderman movies almost tanked this man's career. He has moved on to more serious roles and has been getting a lot of praise for his recent projects ( tick tick. boom was AMAZING btw). 

. If he does this movie and Sony fucks him over again with a poor script its going to set him back..

Comics ,False,"Hey everyone. 

I'll drop the sheet at the bottom of this post. So if you just want that jump down. Before that I was thinking of explaining it and the why and what it does first.

The spreadsheet makes it easy to track your reading progress of the Brian Michael Bendis - Avengers Era. It got links to each issue on the Marvel.com site. And after you finished an issue you can check a box and it tracks your progress. 

My goal is that it makes it easier for new people like myself to get into reading comics. You don't have to find the comics yourself, and if you take a break you know where you were. 

The spreadsheet is as mentioned built upon Tigertemprr's [reading order](https://i.imgur.com/svVKdZs.png) that can be found on the wiki. And I have been in light contact with them as well. They're aware that the reading order is a bit out of date and could be improved upon. So if anyone has recommendations for what to update I am more than willing to take input and make updates. The *Dark Reign* ""event"" is what I got my eyes on right now. But I wanted to stick with this for now. 

#How to use the sheet:
Make a copy of the sheet. Do not request permissions to edit the sheet, I will not accept. Make a copy instead and then you're free to go ahead. 

I recommend that you save this thread for the time being. I will post the updates I make in this thread and on my page.

Why i think its knull because of the celestial post credit it feel like it was the necrosword but the thing is the next thor movies Gorr the God Butcher will be in that movie so there's something wrong with this theory if the necrosword is in earth what will happen to his power(sorry i still nee to this comic stuff but my friends teach me some stuff about some if the characters) but what if in thor love and thunder they defend gorr then the necrosword go to space travel to earth and another hit was venom talking to eddie with this information of the hive will explode his tiny brain. But if they really made this they really need to make the venom 3 or other title what in your mind the venom 2 was kinda rush and was to focus in comedy i wish future marvel movie will be Rated R more dark but a lot of them need some profit but out of topic the next movie Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania will be more dark i thing i wish ant man will die for me so the dark marvel will start so edgy i know but lets go back to the topic knull with the mc universe is putting a lot of power house to fight knull. And this will be the same thing that they will do for endgame try adding new characters and tell about their story then bomb the title knull being darkness that shit corny bruh but if you have a better title drop it

Other,False,"Venom has had MANY hosts across multiple media and interpretations of Spider-Man. If Venom could mutually consensually bond with one host forever, who would he pick?
1. Spidey is the symbiotes “first love”, so there’s some initial bias for him. Plus, while Symbiote Spider-Man may not be the strongest, they are probably the most dangerous combo considering Spidey

2. Eddie Brock has been the main host of Venom for a long time. He’s probably the most experienced, went thru a lotta shit with Venom, the works.

3. Flash Thompson had the symbiote for a while too, just like Brock. Except bonding with Flash actually started to turn Venom good until all evil was purged from him. Plus, didn’t the govt say Flash was a perfect genetic match for Venom?

4. Venom probably wouldn’t pick Mac Gargan, or Deadpool, considering that he turned it crazy

5. Harry Osborn? Maybe? If only from the fact writers love to draw the “brothers” comparison and theme between Harry and Peter, in place of Ultimate Eddie Brock.

TLDR; If venom could choose one host forever, who and why",Marvel,"If Venom had to pick one host, who would he pick?"
Other,False,"TLDR: At Bottom if you don’t like the long explanation of my theory crafting

So until the other day I hadn’t really thought about it but future of Marvel as a whole is really linked to Spider-Man in one way or another when you look at the future lineup of MCU films and Disney+ shows. And also bears many connections to the Netflix crew as well since **Spoiler** they have been popping up a bit in the shows and films

She-Hulk, close friend
Captain Marvel, close friend
The Fantastic Four, treated as a close friend of the family
Daredevil, brother type
Kingpin, main rival and enemy alongside his bro Matt Murdock
Doctor Strange, good friend

Traditionally in the comics he is also friends with Luke Cage and Jessica Jones should they show up too. 

If they decide to move more distant from comics in connections they could have him become friends with Riri Williams (Ironheart) through a Stark connection and she could be how he connects to Kate Bishop which could serve as a Kingpin introduction

Also technically most of the heroes in the upcoming lineup were at one time members of the Defenders in the comics. Strange, Moon Knight, Black Knight, Wasp, She-Hulk, and Hawkeye. The Defenders are one of the groups that Spider-man has a large number of team ups with at least one of their crew in its various rosters. 

TLDR: Spider-Man is very very closely connected in the comic books to a majority of the upcoming heroes and villains in the MCU films and shows.",Marvel,Spider-Man feels centric to the future of the MCU
Film/Television,False,I’ve never really been Into Marvel movies but I’ve always enjoyed the Spider-Man movies so after watching No Way Home last week I’ve decided that I finally want to give Marvel another try. The main reason I haven’t watched them yet is because the 28+ movies and series are very daunting and it seems very time consuming to watch all of it so I decided the best way for me to go about it is maybe watch only 10ish of the main movies that would give me a good understanding of the MCU/the avengers and then later if I want to go back to the smaller movies that don’t really effect to the main storyline as much I can whenever I have the time to. So I was hoping that someone could help me figure out what few movies are the most important and the order I should watch them in?,Marvel,I need help deciding which movies to watch in the MCU
Comics ,False,I'm looking to get some comics for this team but when I do a Google search I can't seem to come up with any issue numbers. Can anyone point me in the right direction? I'm very new to comics.,Marvel,"Team Red (Spider-Man, Deadpool, and Daredevil)"
Other,False,"So, I'm currently working on a story (fanfic, tbh) involving a crossover, and I've been trying to think of an excuse to get one character into the Marvel Universe. I figured my best bet would be to have them appear in the aftermath of a massive multiverse-shattering/threatening event, something that would ""weaken the walls between universes"", stuff like that. So I figured, why not JLA/Avengers? It was published in 2003, not long before Disassembled, so I figured that's a good place to start.

Problem is though, I've checked every comic-reading-order site I know, and surprise-surprise, none of them have an idea for when to place that event (I've honestly never read it, so for all I know, they could have said absolutely nothing in the comic to indicate when it takes place; it might not even take place 'round 2003). I was hoping someone here might have an idea.

And on a second note while asking the above: if you were to place a character; an OC, or just an SI (self-insert) into the Marvel Universe, when do you think is a ""good"" time to do so? Where is there a point where you think it would be most interesting for an outsider to arrive in Earth-616? Right after Disassembled, House of M, or Secret Wars (2015)?

Film/Television,False,"And gotta say I’m quite disappointed, the movie felt like it was trying to do too much in too little time, if they just gave this movie the same runtime as the first, it would’ve given them more time to flesh out the characters, Carnage had no personality and had like 4 lines he was easily the weakest part of the film, Cletus was easily the best part of the movie it was always a blast seeing him on screen. Shriek was a boring character who honestly could’ve been left out and not much would’ve changed. Eddie and Venom’s relationship seemed really rushed but I guess that’s due to the low runtime, Venom seems a lot less threatening in this film then the last but I could be wrong about that. Eddie seems mostly the same, his ex and her new boyfriend also felt rushed with no character development. This film had so much potential and I’m sad that it turned out lackluster.",Marvel,Finally watched Venom:Let there be carnage
Film/Television,False,"First off this is just a post about me ranting off a bit. You don't have to read through it all I just wanted to show my thoughts and dissapointments a bit.

---

Is it just me or is the MCU just sort of looking it at this point? I love most of the movies but lately, especially with Spider-Man NWH and Hawkeye, they have just ende up dissapointing me.

HAWKEYE - The series started good but the interaction with Yelena and Kate in Kate's apartement just made me cringe because of how Yelena behaved. Not having any problems with the acting just how the character Yelena talked and said ""Haiiiiiii"" to Kate just doesn't seem like Yelena to me.

Also when they are fighting in the finale and Kate is somehow almost her equal? I notice Kate is ""losing"" and Yelena is not giving it her all but if she really just wanted to kill her sisters murderer shouldn't she just knock Kate out immediately so she isn't in the way?

Later when Yelena almost has killed Clint several times she points a gun at him, but then she begins to ask questions about her sister? I get she maybe wanted answers but what would have happened if she succeeded in shooting him in the head like 5 minutes ago? That just seems to me like lazy writing, also so they could get that iconic ""character 1 tries to kill character 2 but character 2 just counters and talks to character 1, tries to calm them down and not fight back"".

Lastly how the f*uck Kate could win over kingpin in a timespan of 5 minutes??? HE WAS THE MAIN VILLAIN IN 2 OUT OF 3 DAREDEVIL SEASONS! CRUSHED SKULLS WITH CAR DOORS?! And he is beaten by a teenager in a fight not lasting over 5 minutes. I get that she could'nt win over him by just fighting and she outsmarted him or whatever but to me that just ruins both the character Kingpin and how me as a viewer se him in Daredevil.

SPIDER-MAN NO WAY HOME
I admit I overhyped the movie and was gravely dissapointed in several aspects of the movie. However what I found worst with this movie was not so much story wise, I think it was a fairly good premise, but plotholes and special effects problems.

First off, everyone that came to this universe came because they knew Spider-Man's identity right? Wrong, Electro never found out.

Second off, how was Lizard allowed to just ""wait in the van""? HE IS A WALKING LIZARD LARGER THAN 2 HUMANS PUT TOGETHER?

Third, the special effects annoyed me several times. On Tom's shoes when the doors to Sanctum Sanctorium opened you can clearly see that's CGI (I know it is CGI so obviously it looks like it but be honest, should a movie that's this hyped and with this big budget make those sort of errors?)

Lastly the final fight got me confused several times about what was going on because of all the jump cuts and so on. You CANNOT even compare that final fight to the train fight in Spider-Man 2 or even the fight between Tom and Green Goblin earlier in the movie.

There was, believe it or not, quite a few things I liked about the movie for example from where they go to Happys apartment until Aunt May dies. That whole segment (except for the fact that Lizard was allowed to stay in the van) was really hood I thought.

Overall as stated in the beginning it just feels like MCU is threading on thin ice. And if they are going to keep pumping out movies and shows they better raise their standards otherwise what's the point?",Marvel,MCU is loosing it's touch...

Comics ,False,"Good evening,

I’m looking to get into Marvel comics after being blown away by the post infinity war MCU content. In particular, the What If…? and Spider-Man trilogy has me keen for more. I’m also a huge fan of the X-men animated series from the 90s. 

I’ve been a huge DC fan for about 10 years ever since the Blackest Night storyline and the New 52 reboot. These benefited from the Rebirth stories which allowed even a novice to enter the story. I plan to start with X-Men, Spider-Man and Dr Strange and follow the ‘New to Comics’ guide in the side bar. However, I’m keen at working my way up to another big Endgame or ‘Nexus level’ event (thanks Loki) in due course. Especially with rumours of Kang appearing in the MCU. 

Does Marvel present similar reading opportunities? I’m keen on big assemblies of teams (Blackest Night in comics and the What If…? TV series comes to mind). Are there any recommendations for reading trajectories to take to end up at similar events? What will get me ready for Kang, Strange and the Multiverse?

Thanks.",Marvel,DC reader making a switch
Comics ,False,"&gt;Marvel Cosmic

Basically anything involved with beings outside Earth like the Inhumans, Kree, Skrulls, and Shi'ar. The flagship books would most likely be GOTG, Nova/Silver Surfer, and Thanos.

&gt;Marvel Magic/Supernatural

Doctor Strange and Scarlet Witch are getting alot traction right now. Might as well cash-in like he did with the Avengers back in 2012. This also includes the supernatural beings like Ghost Rider and Blade.

&gt;Spider-Man

As of the moment, I don't see Spidey as something that suits Hickman, but if he steps him up from the street hero stories and goes crazy with the spider-verse, then maybe he could write something out of him.

&gt;Marvel Knights, Street-Heroes

I think this will be the very last thing he'll be writing since his style suits more on vast world-building and sci-fi elements. Daredevil, Luke Cage, etc. are just too grounded for his style, but I'm still interested to see hiw he'll write these characters.

&gt;Marvel S.H.I.E.L.D/Black Ops/Secret Avengers

Not too grounded and not too sci-fi. We got a taste of how he writes Nick Fury and Hawkeye during his Ultimates run. I want to see him do it again. Fury, Hawkeye, Black Widow, Falcon, Winter Soldier, and the Thunderbolts are some big names that I imagine who fit well with this type of genre.

&gt;Return to FF and Avengers

Self-explanatory, but personally, I prefer him to write other stuff.",Marvel,"Since Jonathan Hickman would be leaving the X-Men book, what other series would you like him to write next?"
Film/Television,False,"Hello Guys!

Film/Television,False,it's just not fair to compare a movie made by Stan motherfucking Lee to a movie not made by him especially if you're gonna say the non Stan lee movie is worse because it isn't as good as whatever Stan lee movie you're talking about,Marvel,comparing non Stan Lee movies to Stan lee movied isn't fair
Film/Television,False,"A lot of people have talked about how Strange scewed up the spell in ""No Way Home"" and how he should have been more careful and so on since he almost broke reality and had to make everyone forget who Peter Parker was. Obviously the easy answer is that we wouldn't have a movie if that was the case, but I'd like to bring up something else.

When Strange meets Peter he likely sees himself, sort of. We ""know"" that Tony saw Peter as a younger version of himself that hadn't made any of the mistakes. Stephen likely sees Peter as himself when he was trying to get his own life back together, having nowehere else to go.

As you guys likely recall, Stephen was in a car accident and couldn't use his hands like he used to - he spent all his money on surgeries and was desperate to get his life back to how it was before. He travelled far and eventually reached a place where a sorcerer helped him.

Now, several years later, a young boy has arrived at his doorstep, asking for help just like he did long ago. Peter lost his secret identity and wanted to get his life back to how it was. I believe that Stephen saw this and felt that since he was now the person with the magical powers he could help this young boy. Just like he had gotten help from sorcerers he would now himself be the sorcerer to help someone who was at the end of their rope, seeking help.

It's also no big secret that Strange is a bit arrogant and the he likes to show off, when he met Thor in Ragnarok he kept showing off his magic, when he took care of the blowing wind from the spaceship in Infinity War he winked at Tony, and it likely stroked his ego a bit that Peter would come to him specifically for help.

One major issue that Comixology has is that when Marvel (or DC) re-releases out of print collections by consolidating multiple volumes into a newer, larger volume, they don't actually keep track of that internally.

**Spider-Man: Clone Saga (1994 - 1996) -** The Clone Saga is a complex, intricate storyline that got more and more convoluted as it continued. Some people loved it, others hated it. It's a big investment, even when on sale at this price. These volumes collect EVERYTHING.

**Amazing Spider-Man: The Next Chapter (1999-2001) -** As a result, John Byrne revamped Spider-Man with Howard Mackie co-writing, trying to do a fresh new direction, and a return to basics. It was so-so.

**Amazing Spider-Man by J. Michael Straczynski (2001 to 2007) -** JMS took over after Byrne and Mackie, and did a fresh new start which is mostly beloved, but the last few storylines were meh at best. No one likes the finale, One More Day.

**Brand New Day (2007-2010) -** A new ""back to basics"" status quo for Peter Parker, these underrated stories had to deal with fan frustration at the One More Day retcons, but were a great starting point for new readers.
